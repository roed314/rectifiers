\begin{abstract}

In this paper we propose a natural generalization of rectifiers, the
character twists that appear in the local Langlands correspondence for
$GL(n,F)$.  Our generalization is to arbitrary connected reductive
groups, with certain classes of Langlands parameters.

\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of the notion of a
rectifier.  In particular, we define rectifiers for Langlands
parameters of arbitrary connected reductive groups that map into a
``group of type L''.  We then describe these rectifiers via their
associated Langlands parameters, and show that they are compatible
with the rectifiers of $GL(n,F)$ as in \cite{bushnellhenniart}.

An irreducible smooth representation of the Weil group $W_F$ of $F$ is
called \emph{essentially tame} if its restriction to wild inertia is a
sum of characters.  Let us recall the classical construction of the
essentially tame local Langlands correspondence for $GL(n,F)$.  In the
essentially tame case, an irreducible representation $\varphi : W_F
\rightarrow GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ naturally provides an \emph{admissible
  pair} $(E/F, \xi)$.  Here, $E/F$ is a degree $n$ separable extension
and $\xi$ is a character (with certain conditions) of $E^{\times}$,
which one can view as a maximal elliptic torus in $GL(n,F)$.  Howe
constructs a map (see \cite{howe})
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
isomorphism \ classes \ of \\
admissible \ pairs
\end{array}
\right\} \rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
supercuspidal \ representations \\
of \ GL(n,F)
\end{array} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$\hspace{-.5in} (E/F, \xi) \mapsto \pi_{\xi}$$
The problem is that the obvious map, $$\varphi \mapsto \pi_{\xi},$$
the so-called ``naive correspondence'', is not the local Langlands
correspondence because $\pi_{\xi}$ has the wrong central character.
Instead, the local Langlands correspondence is given by $$\varphi
\mapsto \pi_{\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi}}$$ for some subtle finite order
character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ of $E^{\times}$.  The function $${}_F
\boldsymbol\mu : (E/F, \xi) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ is called the
\emph{rectifier} associated to $E/F$.  Both the description of and the
intuition behind the rectifiers ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu$ have been
studied (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}, \cite{geo}, \cite{adrian}).

One may ask whether rectifiers exist for groups apart from $GL(n,F)$.
Even moreso, how does one define the notion of rectifier for
groups apart from $GL(n,F)$?  The answer can be gleamed from a recent
construction of Benedict Gross, which we briefly describe now (for
more details, see \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).

Suppose that $G$ is a connected reductive group defined over a
$p$-adic field $F$.  Let $\phi : W_F \rightarrow {}^L G$ be a
Langlands parameter for $G(F)$, and suppose that $\phi$ factors
through the normalizer of a maximal torus. To $\phi$, one can
associate a maximal $F$-torus $T$ in $G$, the twisted $F$-torus
associated to $\phi(\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is the geometric Frobenius
\MAxxx{geometric or arithmetic?  does it even make sense to say ``the
  geometric Frobenius of $W_F$''?} of $W_F$.  Suppose that $T$ splits
over the Galois extension $E$ of $F$, and set $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.
Restricting $\phi$ to $W_E$, by the local Langlands correspondence for
tori, one can canonically associate to $\phi$ a character $\xi_{\phi}$
of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, the group of coinvariants of $T(E)$ with respect
to $\Gamma$ (see~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Invariants and coinvariants
are related by the norm map
$$\Nm : T(E) \rightarrow T(F)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(F)
= T(E)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow 1,$$
where $\HT{i}$ denotes $\mathrm{i}^{\mathrm{th}}$ Tate cohomology.

Suppose that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$, in which case
$T(E)_{\Gamma}$ surjects onto $T(F)$\MAxxx{Do we need to suppose this?
It is going to be true once we assume $G$ is semisimple and $T$
unramified, but we don't really need to suppose this now, do we?  I guess
it makes things easier to understand for the reader if we do suppose this
now, because then one can actually twist a character of the coinvariants
to get a character of $T(F)$, whereas one wouldn't be able to do this
if $\HT{0}$ wasn't trivial....hm, ask David if we should delete this
sentence or not.}.  Let us also suppose that
$\phi$ does not factor through a proper Levi subgroup, so that the
representations in the $L$-packet associated to $\phi$ are
conjecturally all supercuspidal (see \cite[\S 3.5]{debackerreeder}).
If $G$ happens to be $GL(n)$, one can compute that
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$, so that
$T(E)_{\Gamma} \cong T(F)$ can be identified with $E^{\times}$, and
$(E/F, \xi)$ is an admissible pair.  To construct the local Langlands
correspondence, one would then proceed (as explained earlier) to
attach the supercuspidal representation $\pi_{\xi \cdot {}_F
  \mu_{\xi}}$ to $\xi$, via the construction of Howe.

If $G$ were arbitrary, then in analogy to the case of $GL(n,F)$, there
exist in certain cases constructions of supercuspidal $L$-packets
$L(\chi)$ associated to characters $\chi$ of tori $T(F)$ in $G(F)$ (see
\cite{debackerreeder}, \cite{kaletha}, \cite{reeder}).  However, as we
have seen, a Langlands parameter $\phi$ as above does not naturally
provide a character of $T(F)$, but rather a character of
$T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{definition}\label{admissibledefinition}
Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $F$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $E$ \MAxxx{Should we include the condition $F$-minisotropic
  in this definition and remove $F$-minisotropic from Definition \ref{regularpairs}?
  The reason I ask is that Bushnell/Henniart define admissible pairs as characters
  of \emph{elliptic} tori.  They don't define admissible pairs for \emph{arbitrary}
  tori}.  Suppose $\xi$ is a character of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.
The pair $(T, \xi)$ is called \emph{admissible} if $\xi$ is not fixed
by any element of $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$. (see Lemma \ref{weylgroups}). \MAxxx{Do we need
to define a notion of isomorphic admissible pairs?  Also, should we
denote by $P_G(F)$ the set of isomorphism classes of admissible pairs?  This
would be in analogy with Bushnell/Henniart's notation $P_n(F)$ for admissible
pairs for elliptic tori in $GL(n,F)$.}
\end{definition}\MAxxx{This definition doesn't seem to be quite right.  I think.
Because the first condition of admissible pair for $GL(n)$ is ``$\chi$ does not
come from the norm for a proper subfield $L$ of $E$ containing $F$, where
$(E/F, \chi)$ is the pair in question.'' If this condition was $\chi$ does not
come from the norm for $E/F$, then this is equivalent to $\chi$ is not fixed by
$Gal(E/F)$, which seems to be our condition...I think we might need to fix our
definition of admissible. Maybe the new condition should be ``$\xi$ is not
fixed by any element of $(N(G,T)/T)(L)$ for any field $L$ such that
$F \subseteq L \subseteq E$''???  This seems reasonable.  Here is why it is
reasonable: We want this condition to generalize the condition that $\chi$
does not comes from the norm for a proper subfield $L$ of $E$ containing $F$.
I am guessing that $(N(G,T)/T)(L) = Gal(E/L)$.  In this case, if $\xi$
is not fixed by $Gal(E/L)$, I think this means that $\xi$ doesn't factor
through the norm for $L$.  Or: it might be that $(N(G,T)/T)(L)$ is not quite
right, because I don't even know if this group acts on $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.  Look
at Lemma 9.1 in my paper with Lansky to get an idea for which group we should
use if it's not $(N(G,T)/T)(L)$.  Whatever it is, it should be equal to
$Gal(E/L)$ if $G = GL(n)$.  Maybe the correct group is
$N(G(E),T(E))^{Gal(E/L)} / T(F)$  (see Lemma 9.1 of my paper with Lansky on
why I would say this).}

\begin{definition}\label{rectifierdefinition}
  Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $F$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $E$.  A \emph{rectifier} for $T$ is a function $${}_F
  \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi)$, a character ${}_F
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is tamely ramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(1 + \mathfrak{p}_E)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(F)}$, the pair $(T, \xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi})$
 is regular \MAxxx{Need to define notion of regularity for characters
    of tori}, and $\phi \mapsto L(\xi_{\phi} \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi_{\phi}})$
  is the local Langlands correspondence.

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is tamely ramified, then
${}_F \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_F \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\MAxxx{Gordan, during my seminar that I gave about this stuff, asked me:
What if $T$ occurs as a torus of two different groups $G$?  Do you 
get the same rectifying character attached to $(T, \xi)$?  That is,
is our function ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu$ well-defined?  Because $(T,\xi)$
could occur for different groups $G_1, G_2$.  If they do, is the associated
rectifier correct in LLC for $G_1$ and $G_2$??? I'm not even sure if 
I formulated this question correctly, and to be honest, I don't know
if Gordan did either, since he didn't completely understand my talk, but
we should probably think about this type of thing...}

\end{definition}

Note that

\begin{conjecture}
  Let $T$ be as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.  Then $T$
  admits a unique rectifier ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto
  {}_F \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{conjecture}

As the local Langlands correspondence is not known in general, we must restrict
ourselves to cases where supercuspidal $L$-packets have been constructed.
Since we are in the present paper considering the situation when $T$ is unramified,
we consider those $L$-packets constructed in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.
We will show that the characters ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ that arise in this setting
happen to be unramified (i.e. trivial on $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$).  This implies,
in particular, that not all possible admissible pairs arise in the settings
of \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.
For example, if $G = GL(n)$, ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ can be ramified,
even if $T$ is unramified.  We will return to this case when supercuspidal $L$-packets
are more generally constructed to allow for ramified ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$.

Since $L$-packets have not been constructed in the generality that
we need in order to prove this conjecture, we prove a theorem that determines
the rectifier in the situation where supercuspidal $L$-packets have been
constructed.\MAxxx{I really like this sentence, as it explains what we will do
in Theorem \ref{regularrectifierdefinition} before we state the theorem. I think
that is important, since it might not be easy to understand what the main
point of the theorem is.  On the other hand, this sentence sounds a bit
redundant when reading it after the previous paragraph.  Ask David what
he thinks.}

\begin{definition}\label{regularpairs}
Let $Reg(F)$ \MAxxx{If we have used the notation $P_G(F)$ to denote
the set of isomorphism classes of admissible pairs earlier, then we can maybe
write $P_G^{Reg}(F)$ instead of $Reg(F)$ here.  I only wrote $Reg(F)$ because
I wanted to change $Reg(T,\xi)$ since it didn't make sense to write
$(T,\xi) \in Reg(T,\xi)$.} denote the set of admissible pairs $(T,\xi)$ such that

(i) $T$ is $F$-minisotropic.\MAxxx{Shouldn't we say ``$T(F)$ is compact''?  Or something
similar?  The reason is that all the theorems we prove about cohomology of unramified tori
give the results that we need only when $T(F)$ is compact.  But maybe $G$ semisimple plus
$T$ being $F$-minisotropic implies that $T(F)$ is compact?  Well, actually, this seems
to be true. Because if $G$ is semisimple, then the center is finite.  But $T$ being
$F$-minisotropic is equivalent to $T(F) / Z(F)$ being compact.  But $Z(F)$ is finite, so
since $T(F) / Z(F)$ is compact, so is $T(F)$  (right???)}

(ii) $\xi$ is trivial on $T(1+\mathfrak{p}_E^{r+1})_{\Gamma}$ but nontrivial on
$T(1+\mathfrak{p}_E^{r})_{\Gamma}$ for some $r \geq 0$.

(iii) $\xi|_{T(1+\mathfrak{p}_E^{r})_{\Gamma}}$ is not fixed by any element of
$(N(G,T)/T)(F)$ (see Definition \ref{admissibledefinition})
\end{definition}
\MAxxx{IMPORTANT: These 3 conditions certainly fall into the set of admissible pairs considered in DeBacker/Reeder and Reeder.  We don't need to find conditions on admissible pairs $(T,\xi)$ that are equivallent to the 3 conditions on Langlands parameters that are considered on page 31 of Reeder's positive depth paper.  We just need our definition of $Reg(F)$ to be a subset of their pairs $(T,\xi)$ so that condition (3) of Theorem \ref{regularrectifierdefinition} makes sense. Note that David has an argument that condition (iii) is equivalent (or implied by?) condition (2) on page 31 of Reeder's positive depth paper.}

We can prove:

\begin{theorem}\label{regularrectifierdefinition}\MAxxx{David seemed a little bit
uncomfortable restating these four conditions, even though two of them are not
really restated, since they are different.  Let's think about how we can
 state this theorem better.}
Let $G$ be semisimple, and $T$ as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.
There exists a unique function $${}_F
  \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}} : Reg(F) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi) \in Reg(F)$, a character ${}_F
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is unramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(F)}$, the pair
$(T, \xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi})$ is regular \MAxxx{Need to define notion of
regularity for characters of tori}, and
$\phi \mapsto L(\xi_{\phi} \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi_{\phi}})$
  agrees with \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is unramified, then
${}_F \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_F \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Once phrased in this manner, uniqueness is a straightforward matter
(see \S\ref{}) \MAxxx{Fix when we can.}. \MAxxx{Wait.  Can we really prove uniqueness?
I don't know if we have an argument.  For example, there might be different
characters of a torus $T(F)$ that give rise to the same supercuspidal $L$-packet.
Is this true?}

The existence of ${}_F  \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}}$
will be proven by interpreting the characters ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$
in terms of a canonical Langlands parameter, as follows.  Let
$G$ be an arbitrary unramified connected reductive group.  If
$T$ is an unramified torus in $G$, then $T$ can be defined
via Galois twisting by a Weyl group element $w$.  We will define
a Langlands parameter $\phi_o :W _F \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
sending Frobenius to a canonical \MAxxx{cCanonical?  Is the Tits group
lift canonical?} lift of $w$, using the Tits group, and by setting
$\phi_o$ to be trivial on $I_F$.
If $G$ is semisimple,
we will prove that the function $$(T, \xi) \mapsto \xi_{\phi_o}$$
satisfies conditions (1)-(4), and we may therefore set
${}_F \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}}(T,\xi) = \xi_{\phi_o}$.
Moreover, we prove compatibility with Bushnell/Henniart:

\begin{theorem}
  If $G = GL(n,F)$, the function $(T,\xi) \mapsto \xi_{\phi_o}$ agrees with
  the rectifier of Bushnell/Henniart, when $(T,\xi) \in Reg(F)$.  Moreover, $\phi_o$ is the
  unique \MAxxx{up to a sign, or something like that?} Langlands
  parameter such that $\xi_{\phi_o} = {}_F \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{theorem}

We would like to note that in the case that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E))
\neq 0$, the situation seems more difficult because twisting $\xi$
by a character of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$
can only result in a character of the image
of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ under the norm map.  However, one might be
able to remedy this with a prediction of central character, as in
\cite{grossreeder}, for example.

\section{Notation and Definitions}

Throughout, $k$ will denote a finite field, and
$k_n$ will denote the degree $n$ extension of
$k$.  $K$ will denote a nonarchimedean local field of
charcteristic zero, and $k$ will be its residue field.  Fix
a uniformizer $\varpi$ of $K$.  Let $K^u$ denote the maximal
unramified extension of $K$, and fix a valuation $\val : (K^u)^\times
\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ normalized so that $\val(\varpi) = 1$.
Write $K_n$ for the unramified extension of $K$ of degree $n$,
and $\Gamma_n = \Gal(K_n/K) = \Gal(k_n/k)$.

\section{Preliminaries}

If $S$ is a torus that is defined over an arbitrary field $F$ and
$E/F$ is a Galois extension, then we have the norm map
$$\Nm_{E/F} : S(E) \rightarrow S(F)$$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ s \mapsto
\prod_{\sigma \in \Gal(E/F)} \sigma(s)$$

\section{Galois cohomology over finite fields}

The following theorem, due to Lang \ref{lang}, underpins the facts in
Section \ref{padic tori} on tori over $p$-adic fields.
Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a commutative connected algebraic group over a
finite field $k$, and suppose $G$ splits over $k_n$.

\begin{theorem}
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, G(k_n)) = 0$ for all $i$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $\Gamma_n$ is cyclic,
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, G(k_n)) \cong \HT{i+2}(\Gamma_n, G(k_n))$,
so it suffices to prove the result for $i=1$ and $i=2$, which is done
in \ref[\SS VI.6]{serre2}.
\end{proof}

\section{Unramified Tori over p-adic fields}

Let $T$ be a torus defined over $K$ that splits over an unramified
extension $L/K$ of degree $n$, set $G = \Gal(L/K)$, and let $g$ be a
generator of $G$.  Recall that, since $G$ is cyclic,
$\HT{i}(G,A)\cong \HT{i+2}(G,A)$ for all $i$, and all
$G$-modules $A$.  Let $X_*(T)$ denote the cocharacter lattice of $T$ and
$X^*(T)$ denote the character lattice of $T$.  As in \cite[Section 3]{moyprasad1},
we define $T_0$ to be the maximal bounded subgroup of
$T(K^u)$, and
$$T_r = \{t \in T_0 : \val(\chi(t) - 1) \geq r \mbox{ for } \chi \in X^*(T) \}$$
for any natural number $r$.  We may
furthermore define $T_r^L = T_r \cap T(L)$ for any field $L$ such
that $K \subset L \subset K^u$.  We wish to compute $\HT{i}(G, T(L))$.
We use the filtration $T_r^L$ on $T(L)$ in the following way.

It is clear that $\Nm_{L/K}$ maps $T_r^L$ into $T_r^K$ for all $r \geq 0$.
Therefore, we get an induced map
$$\Nm_{L/K} : T_s^L / T_{r}^L \rightarrow T_s^K / T_{r}^K$$
for all $r > s \geq 0$.

\begin{lemma}\label{H1compactpart}
$\HT{1}(G, T_{s}^L) = 0$ for $s \geq 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
We prove the case $s = 0$, as the other cases are similar.  Recall
that $T_0^L = \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ T_0^L / T_{r+1}^L$.  We
need the following Lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{abstractcohomology}
  Let $M$ be a $G$-module complete with respect to a topology given by
  a sequence of $G$-invariant subgroups $M = M_0 \supset M_1 \supset
  M_2 \supset ...$, so $\cap M_i = 0$.  Thus,
  $M = \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ M / M_i$.
  If $\HH^1(G, M_i / M_{i+1}) = 0$ for $i \geq 0$,
  then $\HH^1(G, M_i) = 0$ for $i \geq 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof

We do the case $j = 0$.  The argument for $j \geq 1$ is similar.  Let
$f : G \rightarrow M$ be an element in $\HH^1(G,M)$.  We have a natural
map $\HH^1(G, M ) \rightarrow \HH^1(G, M / M_1) = 0$.  Thus, there exists
$m_0 \in M$ such that $f(\sigma) = (\sigma(m_0) - m_0) (\mathrm{mod} \
M_1)$.  Then define $f_1 = f - (\sigma(m_0) - m_0)$.  This is in
$\HH^1(G, M_1)$. But then again we have the natural map
$\HH^1(G, M_1) \rightarrow \HH^1(G, M_1 / M_2) = 0$.  Thus, again, there
exists $m_1 \in M_1$ such that $f_1(\sigma) = (\sigma(m_1) - m_1) (\mathrm{mod} \ M_2)$.
So define $f_2 = f - (\sigma(m) - m) - (\sigma(m_1) - m_1)$.  Continue
this process indefinitely.  Then define
$\tilde{m} = (m_0, m_0 + m_1, m_0 + m_1 + m_2, m_0 + m_1 + m_2
+ m_3, \ldots) \in \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ M / M_i = M$.  Then,
$f(\sigma) = \sigma(\tilde{m}) - \tilde{m}$, so we get finally that
$\HH^1(G,M) = 0$.  \qed

Let $r \geq 1$.  Note that $T_r^L / T_{r+1}^L = X_*(T) \otimes (1 +
\mathfrak{p}_L^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^{r+1}) = X_*(T) \otimes
k_n$.  Well, $X_*(T) \otimes k_n$ is a vector space
over $k$.  But it is known that all forms of vector spaces
are equivalent.  Therefore, the vector space $X_*(T) \otimes
k_n$ with the above Galois action is equivalent to $X_*(T)
\otimes k_n$ with the standard action, i.e. $g \in G$ acts
on $x \otimes z$ by $x \otimes gz$.  Thus, we wish to calculate
$\HT{1}(G, X_*(T) \otimes k_n)$ where $X_*(T) \otimes
k_n$ is given the standard action.  Since $X_*(T) \otimes
k_n$ is just a direct sum of copies of $k_n$, we
are reduced to calculating $\HT{1}(G, k_n)$.  But since
the trace map over finite fields is surjective, we get that
$\HT{0}(G, k_n) = 0$.  Therefore, since the Herbrand
quotient of a finite group is trivial, we get that $\HT{1}(G,
k_n) = 0$.  Finally, $\HT{1}(G, T_0^L / T_1^L) = 0$ by
Lang's theorem since $T_0^L / T_1^L$ is a connected algebraic group
over a finite field.  By Lemma \ref{abstractcohomology}, we have
concluded the proof of Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}.  \qed

\begin{lemma}\label{H0compactpart}
$\HT{0}(G,T_0^L) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
We claim that the natural maps
$$\Nm_{L/K} : T_r^L / T_{r+1}^L \rightarrow T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K$$

are surjective for $r \geq 0$.  First let $r \geq 1$.  First note that
$T_0^L = X_*(T) \otimes \mathcal{O}_L^\times$ and
$T_r^L = X_*(T) \otimes (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^r)$ for $r \geq 1$.  Then
$$\Nm_{L/K} : T_r^L / T_{r+1}^L \rightarrow T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K$$
becomes
$$\Nm_{L/K} : X_*(T) \otimes \left( (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^r) / (1 +
  \mathfrak{p}_L^{r+1}) \right) \rightarrow (X_*(T) \otimes \left( (1 +
  \mathfrak{p}_L^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^{r+1}) \right) )^G$$
since $T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K = T_r^G / T_{r+1}^G = (T_r / T_{r+1})^G$ since
$\HH^1(G, T_{r+1}) = 0$ by Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}.  But
$(1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^{r+1}) \cong \mathcal{O}_L / \mathfrak{p}_L \cong k_n$.
Thus, we get
$$\Nm_{L/K} : X_*(T) \otimes k_n \rightarrow (X_*(T) \otimes k_n)^G$$

Well, $X_*(T) \otimes k_n$ is a vector space over
$k$.  But it is known that all forms of vector spaces are
equivalent.  Therefore, the vector space $X_*(T) \otimes k_n$
with the above Galois action is equivalent to $X_*(T) \otimes k_n$
with the standard action, i.e. $g \in G$ acts on $x \otimes z$ by
$x \otimes gz$.  Therefore,
$$\Nm_{L/K} : X_*(T) \otimes k_n \rightarrow (X_*(T) \otimes k_n)^G$$
becomes
$$\Nm_{L/K} : X_*(T) \otimes k_n \rightarrow X_*(T) \otimes k,$$
which is surjective since the trace map $k_n \rightarrow k$
is surjective.  Now let $r = 0$.  We wish to show that
$$\Nm_{L/K} : T_0^L / T_1^L \rightarrow T_0^K / T_1^K$$
is surjective.  But this map becomes
$$\Nm_{L/K} : X_*(T) \otimes \left( \mathcal{O}_L^\times / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L) \right) \rightarrow (X_*(T) \otimes \left( \mathcal{O}_L^\times / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L) \right) )^G$$
which is just
$$\Nm_{L/K} : \mathbb{T}(k_n) \rightarrow \mathbb{T}(k).$$
This last map is surjective by Lemma \ref{normtorifinitefields}.
Finally, by \cite[Lemma 2, p. 81]{serre}, we have our result.
\qed

\begin{corollary}\label{reductiontori}
$\HT{i}(G, X_*(T) \otimes L^\times) = \HT{i}(G, T(L)) = \HT{i}(G,X_*(T))$ for $i=0,1$.
\end{corollary}

\proof

Recall that $X_*(T) \otimes L^\times \xrightarrow{\sim} T(L)$ given by
evaluation, restricting to an isomorphism $X_*(T) \otimes \mathcal{O}_L^\times
\xrightarrow{\sim} T_0^L$.  We may thus identify $X_*(T)$ with the quotient
$T(L) / T_0^L$, giving rise to the short exact sequence
$$1 \rightarrow T_0^L \rightarrow T(L) \rightarrow X_*(T) \rightarrow 1.$$
We therefore have the long exact sequence
$$... \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T_0^L) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T(L)) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, X_*(T))
\rightarrow \HT{1}(G, T_0^L) \rightarrow $$ $$\HT{1}(G, T(L))
\rightarrow \HT{1}(G, X_*(T)) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T_0^L)
\rightarrow ...$$
By corollary \ref{H0compactpart} and Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}, we get the result.
\qed

\begin{corollary}\label{trivialh0compacttori}
If $T(K)$ is compact, we have $\HT{0}(G, T(L)) = 0$.
\end{corollary}

\proof
$T(K)$ being compact means that $X_*(T)^G = 0$, hence the result follows by corollary \ref{reductiontori}
\qed

\section{Groups of type L}\label{groupsoftypeL}
We now review the theory of ``groups of type L'' due to Benedict
Gross.  Let $F$ be a field, $F^{\mathrm s}$ a separable closure, and
$T$ a torus defined over $F$ that splits over an extension $E \subset
F^s$.  Let $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.  Let $X^*(T)$ be the character module
of $T$ and $X_*(T)$ the cocharacter module of $T$.  Define
$\hat{T} = X^*(T) \otimes \mathbb{C}^\times$.  The group $\Gamma$ acts on
$\hat{T}$ via its action on $X^*(T)$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{group of type L} is a group extension of $\Gamma$ by $\hat{T}$.
\end{definition}

Let $D$ be such a group.  Then we have an exact sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \hat{T} \rightarrow D \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow 1$$

We now describe how, given a Langlands parameter
$$\phi : W_F \rightarrow D,$$
where $D$ is a group of type L, we can naturally attach a character of
$T(E)_{\Gamma} := T(E) / I_{\Gamma}(T(E))$, where
$I_{\Gamma}(T(E)) = \{(1 - \sigma)t \ : t \in T(E), \sigma \in \Gamma \}$.
Restricting $\phi$ to $W_E$ we get a homomorphism
$$\phi|_{W_E} : W_E \rightarrow \hat{T}.$$
By the Langlands correspondence for tori, this gives us a character
$\chi : T(E) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$.  Since $\phi|_{W_E}$ extends
to $\phi$, one can see that
$$\chi(t^{\sigma}) = \chi(t)\ \mbox{for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.}$$
Therefore, $\chi(t^{\sigma - 1}) = 1$ for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.
Thus, $\chi$ is trivial on the augmentation ideal $I_{\Gamma}(T(E))$
and gives $$\chi : T(E)_\Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$$ Invariants
and coinvariants are related by the norm map
$$\Nm : T(E) \rightarrow T(F)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the Tate cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(F)
  = T(E)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow 1$$
(note that the norm map $\Nm$ factors to $T(E)_{\Gamma}$).
We have thus constructed a character $\chi$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ from a
Langlands parameter $\phi$. We note that $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ is a cover of
$\Nm(T(E)_{\Gamma})$, which is a subgroup of $T(F)$.  It is sometimes
the case that $\Nm$ is surjective, in which case $\chi$ is then a
character of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, which is a cover of $T(F)$.

We now give meaning to the definition of \emph{admissible pair} in the introduction.

\begin{lemma}\label{weylgroups}
Let $G$ be a connected reductive $F$-group and let $T$ be a maximal
$F$-torus of $G$.  Let $E$ be the splitting field of $T$, and set
$\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E) \cong (N(G,T)/T)(F)$.
\item The standard action of $N(G(E),T(E)) / T(E)$ on $T(E)$ determines
well-defined actions of $N(G(E), T(E))^{\Gamma} / T(F)$ and $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$
on $T(E)$, which factor naturally to actions on $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\proof
See \cite{adrianlansky}.
\qed

We will need the following structural result about Langlands
parameters mapping to groups of type $L$ later.  First let $E,F,T,\hat{T}, \Gamma$
be as above, with $E/F$ unramified.  Let $\varphi_1 : W_F \rightarrow D$
be a Langlands parameter mapping to a group of type $L$.  $\varphi_1$
gives rise to a character $\chi_1$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.  Let $\varphi_2
: W_F \rightarrow D$ be defined by $\varphi_2|_{I_F} \equiv \varphi_1|_{I_F}$ and
$\varphi_2(\Phi_F) = t \varphi_1(\Phi_F)$ for some $t \in \hat{T}$.
$\varphi_2$ gives rise to a character $\chi_2$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{toralmodification}
$\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ have the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
Let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\Gamma$.  First note that
$\varphi_1(\Phi_E) = \varphi_1(\Phi_F)^r$, where $r$ is the
order of $\Gamma$.
Suppose $\varphi_1(\Phi_F) = n \in N_{{}^L G}(\hat{T})$.
Note that $n^r$ is an element in the dual torus
$\hat{T}$.

By Corollary \ref{reductiontori}, we know that
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T))$,
since $E/F$ is unramified.  Moreover,
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T)) = \ker(\Nm : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T)) / I_{\Gamma}(T(E))$.

Let $\lambda \in \ker(\Nm : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T))$.  Note that
$\lambda \in X^*(\hat{T})$.
Write $n^r = \mu \otimes z$, for some $\mu \in X_*(\hat{T})$,
$z \in \mathbb{C}^\times$.  Then $\chi_1(\lambda) = z^{<\mu, \lambda>}$
(where $< , >$ denotes the canonical pairing
on $X_*(\hat{T}) \times X^*(\hat{T})$ ).

We now note that
$$(tn)^r = t ntn^{-1} n^2 t n^{-2} \cdots n^{r-1} t n^{1-r} n^r = t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t),$$
where $w$ is the Weyl group element associated to $n$.  If we write
$t = \mu' \otimes z'$, then $$t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t) = \Nm(\mu' ) \otimes z',$$
But now one checks:
We have $\chi_2(\lambda) = z^{<\mu, \lambda>} (z' )^{<\Nm(\mu'), \lambda>}$, and
$$<\Nm(\mu'), \lambda> = < \mu' + \sigma(\mu') + \sigma^2(\mu') + ... + \sigma^{r-1}(\mu'), \lambda>
  = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} < \sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda >$$
Since $< , >$ is Galois equivariant, $<\sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda> =
<\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)>$.  Thus, the sum
becomes
$$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} <\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)> = <\mu', \Nm(\lambda)>.$$
But $\lambda \in \ker(\Nm : X^*(\hat{T}) \rightarrow X^*(\hat{T}))$, so
$<\mu', \Nm(\lambda)> = 0$.  Therefore, $\chi_2(\lambda) =
z^{<\mu, \lambda>} = \chi_1(\lambda)$.
\qed

\section{The relationship between the Gross construction and the DeBacker--Reeder construction}\label{grossdebackerreeder}

We consider here an RSELP $\phi$ for any unramified connected
reductive group G.  Let $T$ be as in \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $E$,
$\chi$, etc.~be as in~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $w$ be the Weyl
group element associated to $\phi$, and set $\sigma = w \theta\in {\rm Aut}(T)$.
Let $\chi_{\phi}$ be the character of $T(F) = T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$ that
DeBacker and Reeder attach to $\phi$.

We have the exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(F)
  \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow 1$$

where $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.  Recall that $\phi$ canonically gives
rise to a character $\chi$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, by local Langlands
for tori (see section \ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Note that the above
exact sequence restricts to an exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\mathcal{O}_E)) \rightarrow T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}
  \rightarrow T(\mathcal{O}_F) \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\mathcal{O}_E)) \rightarrow 1$$

Moreover, by Lemmas \ref{H1compactpart} and \ref{H0compactpart}, we have
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\mathcal{O}_E)) = \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\mathcal{O}_E)) = 1$.
Therefore, the map
$$T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(\mathcal{O}_F)$$
is an isomorphism, and we may view
$\chi|_{T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}}$ as a character of
$T(\mathcal{O}_F)$ via this isomorphism.  Now, since $\chi$ was
obtained from $\phi|_{W_E}$ via the local Langlands correspondence, one can see
from the constructions in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder} that
$\chi_{\phi} \circ \Nm = \chi$ on $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$ (one can see
\cite{adrianlansky} for more details on the constructions of
\cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder} and their relationship to groups of
type $L$).
We have therefore proven the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}
  The restriction to $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\sim} T(\mathcal{O}_F)$
  of the genuine character arising from the Gross construction
  coincides with the character of $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$ that is
  constructed from $\phi$ via the construction of DeBacker--Reeder
  construction.
\end{lemma}

\section{Rectifiers and DeBacker/Reeder}\label{mainresults}

Recall that we have fixed a splitting $(\hat{T}, \hat{B}, \{x_{\alpha} \})$
for the dual group $\hat{G}$ and that $\hat{N} = N_{\hat{G}}(\hat{T})$.
For each simple root $\alpha$, let $\phi_{\alpha} : SL(2) \rightarrow \hat{G}$
be defined by $\phi_{\alpha}(\mathrm{diag}(z,1/z)) = \alpha^{\vee}(z)$
and $\phi_{\alpha}\mat{1}{1}{0}{1} = x_{\alpha}$. Let
$\sigma_{\alpha} = \phi_{\alpha}\mat{0}{1}{-1}{0}$.

\begin{definition}
  The Tits group $\widetilde{W}$ is the subgroup of $\hat{N}$
  generated by $\{\sigma_{\alpha} \}$ for $\alpha$ simple.
\end{definition}

For each simple root $\alpha$, let $m_{\alpha} = \sigma_{\alpha}^2 = \alpha^{\vee}(-1)$.
Let $\hat{T}_2$ be the subgroup of $\hat{T}$ generated by the $m_{\alpha}$.

\begin{theorem}{(Tits \cite{tits})}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The kernel of the natural map $\widetilde{W_o} \rightarrow \hat{W}_o$
  is $\hat{T}_2$,
\item The elements $\sigma_{\alpha}$ satisfy the braid relations,
\item There is a canonical lifting of $\hat{W}_o$ to a subset of
  $\widetilde{W}$: take a reduced expression $w = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$,
  and let $\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} ... \sigma_{\alpha_n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Let $\phi$ be a RSELP.  Then $\phi(I_F) \subset \hat{T}$ and
$\phi(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} f$ for some $f \in \hat{N}$.  Let $\hat{w}$
be the image of $f$ in $\hat{W}_o$, and let $w$ be the element of
$W_o$ corresponding to $\hat{w}$.  Write $\hat{w} = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$
as a product of simple reflections, and let
$\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} \cdots \sigma_{\alpha_n}$ be the \MAxxx{the?  Is there
a canonical lift?}
canonical lift of $\hat{w}$ to $\widetilde{W}$.

\begin{definition}
Given $\phi$, we define a homomorphism $\phi_o : W_F \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi_o|_{I_F} \equiv 1$
\item $\phi_o(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} \tilde{w}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

By the theory in section \ref{preliminaries}, $\phi$ and $\phi_o$ give
rise to a character $\chi_{\phi}$ and $\chi_{\phi_o}$ of
$T(F) = T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$, respectively.  By the theory in section
\ref{groupsoftypeL}, $\phi$ and $\phi_o$ gives rise to characters
$\xi_{\phi}$ and $\xi_{\phi_o}$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, respectively.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is semisimple, then $\xi_{\phi} \otimes \xi_{\phi_o}^{-1} = \chi_{\phi}$.
\end{proposition}

\proof
Since $G$ is semisimple, $T(F)$ is compact.  In particular,
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$ by Corollary \ref{trivialh0compacttori},
so we have the following exact sequence:
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(F) \rightarrow 1$$
Note that $T(F) = T(\mathcal{O}_F)$, and so in particular
$T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$ surjects onto $T(F)$ via the norm map
$\Nm$.  This, together with the fact that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \neq 0$,
gives us that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E))$ and
$T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$ together generate $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

Since $\phi_o|_{I_F} \equiv 1$, $\xi_{\phi_o}$ is trivial on
$T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$.  By lemma
\ref{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}, we have that
$(\xi_{\phi} \otimes \xi_{\phi_o}^{-1})|_{T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}} = \chi_{\phi}|_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}$.
Therefore, $\xi_{\phi} \otimes \xi_{\phi_o}^{-1}$ is correct on
$T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$.  Moreover, by Lemma
\ref{toralmodification}, we also have that $\xi_{\phi}$ and $\xi_{\phi_o}$ have
the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$.  Therefore,
$\xi_{\phi} \otimes \xi_{\phi_o}^{-1}$ is a character of $T(F)$.  Since
$\xi_{\phi} \otimes \xi_{\phi_o}^{-1}$ is correct on $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma}$, and
since $T(\mathcal{O}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(F)$ is surjective,
we are done.
\qed

In the case that $G$ is semisimple, there was nothing special about
$\phi_o$.  In fact, by the same arguments, $\xi_{\phi_o} = \xi_{\phi'}$
for any Langlands parameter $\phi'$ such that $\phi'|_{I_F} \equiv 1$
and $\phi'(\Phi) = w'$, where $w'$ was any lift of $\hat{w}$ to $N$.
However, we will see that the \MAxxx{the Tits group lift or a Tits group
 lift?} Tits group lift is forced on us when we
consider groups that are not necessarily semisimple, such as $GL(n,F)$.

\section{Rectifiers for $GL(n,F)$}\label{GL(n)}

We first recall the structure of the rectifiers for $GL(n,F)$ in our
setting (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}).

\begin{lemma}
  Suppose that $(E/F, \xi)$ is an admissible pair such that $E/F$ is
  unramified of degree $n$ and $\xi|_{\mathcal{O}_E} \equiv 1$.
  Then ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is unramified and
  ${}_F \mu_{\xi}(\varpi) = (-1)^{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
See \cite[Proposition 21]{bushnellhenniart}.
\qed

\begin{proposition}
Let $\hat{w} = s_{\alpha_1} s_{\alpha_2} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$ where
$s_{\alpha_i}$ are the simple reflections of $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$,
for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.  Then $\tilde{w}^n = (-Id)^{n-1}$, where $Id$
denotes the identity element in $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$.
\end{proposition}

\MAxxx{In this section somewhere, should we calculate $\HT{0}$ and
  $\HT{-1}$ for unramified tori of $GL(n)$? We have done this
  already, and it's easy.  Maybe we can use it for something, or
  explain something with it (like Gross's construction, together with
  our rectifiers, for $GL(n)$.  That would be nice)}
