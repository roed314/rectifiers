\begin{abstract}

In this paper we propose a natural generalization of rectifiers, the
character twists that appear in the local Langlands correspondence for
$GL(n,K)$.  Our generalization is to arbitrary connected reductive
groups, with certain classes of Langlands parameters.

\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of the notion of a
rectifier.  In particular, we define rectifiers for Langlands
parameters of arbitrary connected reductive groups that map into a
``group of type L''.  We then describe these rectifiers via their
associated Langlands parameters, and show that they are compatible
with the rectifiers of $GL(n,K)$ as in \cite{bushnellhenniart}.
\MAxxx{In the introduction, I should outline the case of $PGL(2,K)$
and therefore the notion of rectifier (i.e. first take Langlands
parameter, then do the natural thing to it, then ``rectify''
the situation) can be seen very clearly for $PGL(2,K)$.}

An irreducible smooth representation of the Weil group $W_K$ of $K$ is
called \emph{essentially tame} if its restriction to wild inertia is a
sum of characters.  Let us recall the classical construction of the
essentially tame local Langlands correspondence for $GL(n,K)$.  In the
essentially tame case, an irreducible representation $\varphi : W_K
\rightarrow GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ naturally provides an \emph{admissible
  pair} $(L/K, \xi)$.  Here, $L/K$ is a degree $n$ separable extension
and $\xi$ is a character (with certain conditions) of $L^{\times}$,
which one can view as a maximal elliptic torus in $GL(n,K)$.  Howe
constructs a map (see \cite{howe})
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
isomorphism \ classes \ of \\
admissible \ pairs
\end{array}
\right\} \rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
supercuspidal \ representations \\
of \ GL(n,K)
\end{array} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$\hspace{-.5in} (L/K, \xi) \mapsto \pi_{\xi}$$
The problem is that the obvious map, $$\varphi \mapsto \pi_{\xi},$$
the so-called ``naive correspondence'', is not the local Langlands
correspondence because $\pi_{\xi}$ has the wrong central character.
Instead, the local Langlands correspondence is given by $$\varphi
\mapsto \pi_{\xi \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi}}$$ for some subtle finite order
character ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ of $L^{\times}$.  The function $${}_K
\boldsymbol\mu : (L/K, \xi) \mapsto {}_K \mu_{\xi}$$ is called the
\emph{rectifier} associated to $L/K$.  Both the description of and the
intuition behind the rectifiers ${}_K \boldsymbol\mu$ have been
studied (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}, \cite{geo}, \cite{adrian}).

One may ask whether rectifiers exist for groups apart from $GL(n,K)$.
Even moreso, how does one define the notion of rectifier for
groups apart from $GL(n,K)$?  The answer can be gleamed from a recent
construction of Benedict Gross, which we briefly describe now (for
more details, see \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).

Suppose that $G$ is a connected reductive group defined over a
$p$-adic field $K$.  Let $\varphi : W_K \rightarrow {}^L G$ be a
Langlands parameter for $G(K)$, and suppose that $\varphi$ factors
through the normalizer of a maximal torus. To $\varphi$, one can
associate a maximal $K$-torus $T$ in $G$, the twisted $K$-torus
associated to $\varphi(\Fr)$, where $\Fr$ is the geometric Frobenius
\MAxxx{geometric or arithmetic?  does it even make sense to say ``the
  geometric Frobenius of $W_K$''?} of $W_K$.  Suppose that $T$ splits
over the Galois extension $L$ of $K$, and set $\Gamma = \Gal(L/K)$.
Restricting $\varphi$ to $W_L$, by the local Langlands correspondence for
tori, one can canonically associate to $\varphi$ a character $\xi_{\varphi}$
of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$, the group of coinvariants of $T(L)$ with respect
to $\Gamma$ (see~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Invariants and coinvariants
are related by the norm map
$$\Nm : T(L) \rightarrow T(K)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(L)) \rightarrow T(L)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(K)
= T(L)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(L)) \rightarrow 1,$$
where $\HT{i}$ denotes $\mathrm{i}^{\mathrm{th}}$ Tate cohomology.

Suppose that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(L)) = 0$, in which case
$T(L)_{\Gamma}$ surjects onto $T(K)$\MAxxx{Do we need to suppose this?
It is going to be true once we assume $G$ is semisimple and $T$
unramified, but we don't really need to suppose this now, do we?  I guess
it makes things easier to understand for the reader if we do suppose this
now, because then one can actually twist a character of the coinvariants
to get a character of $T(K)$, whereas one wouldn't be able to do this
if $\HT{0}$ wasn't trivial....hm, ask David if we should delete this
sentence or not.}.  Let us also suppose that
$\varphi$ does not factor through a proper Levi subgroup, so that the
representations in the $L$-packet associated to $\varphi$ are
conjecturally all supercuspidal (see \cite[\S 3.5]{debackerreeder}).
If $G$ happens to be $GL(n)$, one can compute that
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(L)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L)) = 0$, so that
$T(L)_{\Gamma} \cong T(K)$ can be identified with $L^{\times}$, and
$(L/K, \xi)$ is an admissible pair.  To construct the local Langlands
correspondence, one would then proceed (as explained earlier) to
attach the supercuspidal representation $\pi_{\xi \cdot {}_K
  \mu_{\xi}}$ to $\xi$, via the construction of Howe.

If $G$ were arbitrary, then in analogy to the case of $GL(n,K)$, there
exist in certain cases constructions of supercuspidal $L$-packets
$L(\chi)$ associated to characters $\chi$ of tori $T(K)$ in $G(K)$ (see
\cite{debackerreeder}, \cite{kaletha}, \cite{reeder}).  However, as we
have seen, a Langlands parameter $\varphi$ as above does not naturally
provide a character of $T(K)$, but rather a character of
$T(L)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{definition}\label{admissibledefinition}
Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $K$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $L$ \MAxxx{Should we include the condition $K$-minisotropic
  in this definition and remove $K$-minisotropic from Definition \ref{regularpairs}?
  The reason I ask is that Bushnell/Henniart define admissible pairs as characters
  of \emph{elliptic} tori.  They don't define admissible pairs for \emph{arbitrary}
  tori}.  Suppose $\xi$ is a character of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.
The pair $(T, \xi)$ is called \emph{admissible} if $\xi$ is not fixed
by any element of $(N(G,T)/T)(K)$. (see Lemma \ref{weylgroups}). \MAxxx{Do we need
to define a notion of isomorphic admissible pairs?  Also, should we
denote by $P_G(K)$ the set of isomorphism classes of admissible pairs?  This
would be in analogy with Bushnell/Henniart's notation $P_n(K)$ for admissible
pairs for elliptic tori in $GL(n,K)$.}
\end{definition}\MAxxx{This definition doesn't seem to be quite right.  I think.
Because the first condition of admissible pair for $GL(n)$ is ``$\chi$ does not
come from the norm for a proper subfield $M$ of $L$ containing $K$, where
$(L/K, \chi)$ is the pair in question.'' If this condition was $\chi$ does not
come from the norm for $L/K$, then this is equivalent to $\chi$ is not fixed by
$Gal(L/K)$, which seems to be our condition...I think we might need to fix our
definition of admissible. Maybe the new condition should be ``$\xi$ is not
fixed by any element of $(N(G,T)/T)(M)$ for any field $M$ such that
$K \subseteq M \subseteq L$''???  This seems reasonable.  Here is why it is
reasonable: We want this condition to generalize the condition that $\chi$
does not comes from the norm for a proper subfield $M$ of $L$ containing $K$.
I am guessing that $(N(G,T)/T)(M) = Gal(L/M)$.  In this case, if $\xi$
is not fixed by $Gal(L/M)$, I think this means that $\xi$ doesn't factor
through the norm for $M$.  Or: it might be that $(N(G,T)/T)(M)$ is not quite
right, because I don't even know if this group acts on $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.  Look
at Lemma 9.1 in my paper with Lansky to get an idea for which group we should
use if it's not $(N(G,T)/T)(M)$.  Whatever it is, it should be equal to
$Gal(L/M)$ if $G = GL(n)$.  Maybe the correct group is
$N(G(L),T(L))^{Gal(L/M)} / T(K)$  (see Lemma 9.1 of my paper with Lansky on
why I would say this).}
\MAxxx{Look at Lemma 2.2.1 of https://web.math.princeton.edu/$\sim$tkaletha/sscgln.pdf}

\begin{definition}\label{rectifierdefinition}
  Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $K$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $L$.  A \emph{rectifier} for $T$ is a function $${}_K
  \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto {}_K \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi)$, a character ${}_K
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The character ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ is tamely ramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(1 + \mathfrak{p}_L)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\xi \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(K)}$, the pair $(T, \xi \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi})$
 is regular \MAxxx{Need to define notion of regularity for characters
    of tori}, and $\varphi \mapsto L(\xi_{\varphi} \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi_{\varphi}})$
  is the local Langlands correspondence.

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is tamely ramified, then
${}_K \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_K \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\MAxxx{Gordan, during my seminar that I gave about this stuff, asked me:
What if $T$ occurs as a torus of two different groups $G$?  Do you
get the same rectifying character attached to $(T, \xi)$?  That is,
is our function ${}_K \boldsymbol\mu$ well-defined?  Because $(T,\xi)$
could occur for different groups $G_1, G_2$.  If they do, is the associated
rectifier correct in LLC for $G_1$ and $G_2$??? I'm not even sure if
I formulated this question correctly, and to be honest, I don't know
if Gordan did either, since he didn't completely understand my talk, but
we should probably think about this type of thing...}

\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
  Let $T$ be as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.  Then $T$
  admits a unique rectifier ${}_K \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto
  {}_K \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{conjecture}

We first note that the definition of admissible pair above generalizes 
the notion of admissible pair of \cite{bushnellhenniart}.  Indeed,
if $G = GL(n)$, and $T$ is an elliptic torus in $G$ splitting over
an unramified extension $L/K$, then one can show that
$(N(G,T)/T)(K) = Gal(L/K)$.  Thus, for $\xi$ to not be fixed by any
element of $(N(G,T)/T)(K)$ is equivalent to $\xi$ not being fixed by
any subgroup of $Gal(L/K)$.  This can be seen to be equivalent to $\xi$
not coming from the norms $N_{L/M}$ for any proper subfield $M$ contained
in $L$, containing $K$.

We next note that as the local Langlands correspondence is not known in general, we must restrict
ourselves to cases where supercuspidal $L$-packets have been constructed.
Since we are in the present paper considering the situation when $T$ is unramified,
we consider those $L$-packets constructed in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.
We will show that the characters ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ that arise in this setting
happen to be unramified (i.e. trivial on $T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$).  This implies,
in particular, that not all possible admissible pairs arise in the settings
of \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.
For example, if $G = GL(n)$, ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ can be ramified,
even if $T$ is unramified.  We will return to this case when supercuspidal $L$-packets
are more generally constructed to allow for ramified ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$.

Since $L$-packets have not been constructed in the generality that
we need in order to prove this conjecture, we prove a theorem that determines
the rectifier in the situation where supercuspidal $L$-packets have been
constructed.\MAxxx{I really like this sentence, as it explains what we will do
in Theorem \ref{regularrectifierdefinition} before we state the theorem. I think
that is important, since it might not be easy to understand what the main
point of the theorem is.  On the other hand, this sentence sounds a bit
redundant when reading it after the previous paragraph.  Ask David what
he thinks.}

\begin{definition}\label{regularpairs}
Let $Reg(K)$ \MAxxx{If we have used the notation $P_G(K)$ to denote
the set of isomorphism classes of admissible pairs earlier, then we can maybe
write $P_G^{Reg}(K)$ instead of $Reg(K)$ here.  I only wrote $Reg(K)$ because
I wanted to change $Reg(T,\xi)$ since it didn't make sense to write
$(T,\xi) \in Reg(T,\xi)$.} denote the set of admissible pairs $(T,\xi)$ such that

(i) $T$ is $K$-minisotropic.\MAxxx{Shouldn't we say ``$T(K)$ is compact''?  Or something
similar?  The reason is that all the theorems we prove about cohomology of unramified tori
give the results that we need only when $T(K)$ is compact.  But maybe $G$ semisimple plus
$T$ being $K$-minisotropic implies that $T(K)$ is compact?  Well, actually, this seems
to be true. Because if $G$ is semisimple, then the center is finite.  But $T$ being
$K$-minisotropic is equivalent to $T(K) / Z(K)$ being compact.  But $Z(K)$ is finite, so
since $T(K) / Z(K)$ is compact, so is $T(K)$  (right???)}

(ii) $\xi$ is trivial on $T(1+\mathfrak{p}_L^{r+1})_{\Gamma}$ but nontrivial on
$T(1+\mathfrak{p}_L^{r})_{\Gamma}$ for some $r \geq 0$.

(iii) $\xi|_{T(1+\mathfrak{p}_L^{r})_{\Gamma}}$ is not fixed by any element of
$(N(G,T)/T)(K)$ (see Definition \ref{admissibledefinition})
\end{definition}
\MAxxx{IMPORTANT: These 3 conditions certainly fall into the set of admissible pairs considered in DeBacker/Reeder and Reeder.  We don't need to find conditions on admissible pairs $(T,\xi)$ that are equivallent to the 3 conditions on Langlands parameters that are considered on page 31 of Reeder's positive depth paper.  We just need our definition of $Reg(K)$ to be a subset of their pairs $(T,\xi)$ so that condition (3) of Theorem \ref{regularrectifierdefinition} makes sense. Note that David has an argument that condition (iii) is equivalent (or implied by?) condition (2) on page 31 of Reeder's positive depth paper.}

We can prove:

\begin{theorem}\label{regularrectifierdefinition}\MAxxx{David seemed a little bit
uncomfortable restating these four conditions, even though two of them are not
really restated, since they are different.  Let's think about how we can
 state this theorem better.}
Let $G$ be semisimple, and $T$ as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.
There exists a unique function $${}_K
  \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}} : Reg(K) \mapsto {}_K \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi) \in Reg(K)$, a character ${}_K
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The character ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ is unramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\xi \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(K)}$, the pair
$(T, \xi \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi})$ is regular \MAxxx{Need to define notion of
regularity for characters of tori}, and
$\varphi \mapsto L(\xi_{\varphi} \cdot {}_K \mu_{\xi_{\varphi}})$
  agrees with \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is unramified, then
${}_K \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_K \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Once phrased in this manner, uniqueness is a straightforward matter
(see \S\ref{}) \MAxxx{Fix when we can.}. \MAxxx{Wait.  Can we really prove uniqueness?
I don't know if we have an argument.  For example, there might be different
characters of a torus $T(K)$ that give rise to the same supercuspidal $L$-packet.
Is this true?}

The existence of ${}_K  \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}}$
will be proven by interpreting the characters ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$
in terms of a canonical Langlands parameter, as follows.  Let
$G$ be an arbitrary unramified connected reductive group.  If
$T$ is an unramified torus in $G$, then $T$ can be defined
via Galois twisting by a Weyl group element $w$.  We will define
a Langlands parameter $\varphi_o :W _K \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
sending Frobenius to a canonical \MAxxx{cCanonical?  Is the Tits group
lift canonical?} lift of $w$, using the Tits group, and by setting
$\varphi_o$ to be trivial on $I_K$.
If $G$ is semisimple,
we will prove that the function $$(T, \xi) \mapsto \xi_{\varphi_o}$$
satisfies conditions (1)-(4), and we may therefore set
${}_K \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}}(T,\xi) = \xi_{\varphi_o}$.
Moreover, we prove compatibility with Bushnell/Henniart:

\begin{theorem}
  If $G = GL(n,K)$, the function $(T,\xi) \mapsto \xi_{\varphi_o}$ agrees with
  the rectifier of Bushnell/Henniart, when $(T,\xi) \in Reg(K)$.  Moreover, $\varphi_o$ is the
  unique \MAxxx{up to a sign, or something like that?} Langlands
  parameter such that $\xi_{\varphi_o} = {}_K \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{theorem}

We would like to note that in the case that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(L))
\neq 0$, the situation seems more difficult because twisting $\xi$
by a character of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$
can only result in a character of the image
of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$ under the norm map.  However, one might be
able to remedy this with a prediction of central character, as in
\cite{grossreeder}, for example.

\section{Notation and Preliminaries}

Throughout, $k$ will denote a finite field, and
$k_n$ will denote the degree $n$ extension of
$k$.  $K$ will denote a nonarchimedean local field of
charcteristic zero, and $k$ will be its residue field.  Fix
a uniformizer $\varpi$ of $K$.  Let $K^u$ denote the maximal
unramified extension of $K$, and fix a valuation $\val : (K^u)^\times
\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ normalized so that $\val(\varpi) = 1$.
Write $K_n$ for the unramified extension of $K$ of degree $n$,
and $\Gamma_n = \Gal(K_n/K) = \Gal(k_n/k)$.

A geometric Frobenius is an element of $\Gal(\bar{K}/K)$
inducing the automorphism $x \mapsto x^{1/p}$ of $\bar{k}$.  Under the
Artin reciprocity map of local class field theory the choice of uniformizer $\varpi$
determines a geometric Frobenius $\Fr$ \cite[\S 2]{serre1}.

If $T$ is a torus defined over $K$ we write $X^*(T)$
for the character lattice $\Hom_{\bar{K}}(T, \Gm)$ and $X_*(T)$ for the
cocharacter lattice $\Hom_{\bar{K}}(\Gm, T)$ \cite[\S 16.2]{humphreys}.
$T$ will split over an extension
$L$ of $K$ if and only if $\Gal(\bar{K}/L)$ acts trivially on $X^*(T)$.
We may thus define \emph{the} splitting field $L$ of $T$ as the
minimal extension of $K$ splitting $T$; note that $L$ is necessarily
Galois over $K$.  Write $\Gamma$ for $\Gal(L/K)$; $X_*(T)$, $X^*(T)$ and $T(L)$
are all $\Gamma$-modules.

Let $\hat{T}$ be the dual torus over $\CC$ with $X_*(\hat{T}) = X^*(T)$ and
$X^*(\hat{T}) = X_*(T)$.  By transport of structure $\hat{T}$ is also a $\Gamma$-module.
For $\lambda \in X_*(T)$ and $\mu \in X^*(T)$ we write $\la \lambda, \mu \ra$
for the canonical $\Gamma$-equivariant pairing
$$\Hom_{\bar{K}}(\Gm, T) \times \Hom_{\bar{K}}(T, \Gm) \rightarrow \Hom_{\bar{K}}(\Gm, \Gm) \cong \ZZ.$$

For any Galois extension $E$ of $K$ we have the norm map
\begin{align*}
\Nm_{E/K} : S(E) &\rightarrow S(K) \\
s &\mapsto \prod_{\sigma \in \Gal(E/K)} \sigma(s).
\end{align*}

The following theorem, due to Lang \cite{lang}, underpins the facts in
Section \ref{padic tori} on tori over $p$-adic fields.
Let $H$ be a commutative connected algebraic group over a
finite field $k$, and suppose $H$ splits over $k_n$.

\begin{theorem} \label{langs thm}
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, H(k_n)) = 0$ for all $i$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $\Gamma_n$ is cyclic,
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, H(k_n)) \cong \HT{i+2}(\Gamma_n, H(k_n))$ \cite[Thm. 5]{atiyah-wall},
so it suffices to prove the result for $i=1$ and $i=2$, which is done
by Serre \cite[\S VI.6]{serre2}.
\end{proof}

\section{Tori over $p$-adic fields} \label{padic tori}

Let $T$ be a torus defined over $K$.    Let $K_n$ be the maximal unramified subextension
of the splitting field $L$, and set $I = \Gal(L/K_n)$.

Let $\TT$ be the N\'eron model of $T$, a canonical model of $T$
over $\OK$ \cite[Ch. 10]{blr}.  As a consequence of the N\'eron mapping
property, we may identify $\TT(\OK)$ with $T(K)$.  The connected
component of the identity, $\TT^\circ$, cuts out a subgroup
$T(K)_0 = \TT^\circ(\OK)$ of $T(K)$; we also write $T(K_n)_0$ for
$\TT^\circ(\OKn)$.

In fact, this subgroup of $T(K)$ is the first in a decreasing filtration.
Moy and Prasad \cite{moyprasad1} define one such filtration by
embedding $T$ into an induced torus and defining the filtration of
$\Res_{L/K} \Gm$ in terms of the valuation on $L$.  Yu \cite[\S 5]{yu}
describes a different filtration, agreeing with that of Moy and Prasad
in the case of tame tori but with nicer features in the presence of wild
ramification.  Let $\TT_r$ be the integral model of $T$ defined in Yu's
minimal congruent filtration, and let $\{T(K)_r\}_{r \ge 0}$ and
$\{T(K_n)_r\}_{r \ge 0}$ be the corresponding filtrations of $T(K)$ and
$T(K_n)$.

Let $\C$ be the scheme of
connected components of $\TT$, which we may identify with the
components of $\TT \times \Spec(k)$ since $T = \TT \times \Spec(K)$
is connected.  The structure of $\C$ is described by Xarles:

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Cor. 2.12]{xarles}}]
There is an exact sequence of $\Gamma_n$-modules
$$0 \rightarrow \Hom_{\ZZ}(\HH^1(I, X^*(T)), \QQ/\ZZ) \rightarrow
\C \rightarrow \Hom_{\ZZ}(X^*(T)^I, \ZZ) \rightarrow 0.$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}[{\cite[Thm. 1.1]{xarles}}] \label{unram comps}
If $T$ is unramified, then $\C \cong X_*(T)$.
\end{corollary}

Using our filtration of $T(K_n)$, we may relate the cohomology of $T(K_n)$
with that of $\C$.

\begin{proposition}
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)_0) = 0$ for all $i$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Note that
$$T(K_n)_0 = \lim_{\leftarrow r} T(K_n)_0 / T(K_n)_r.$$
So by a result of Serre \cite[Lem. 3]{serre1}, it suffices to prove that
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)_r / T(K_n)_{r+}) = 0$ for all $i$.  But $T(K_n)_r / T(K_n)_{r+}$
is connected \cite[Prop. 5.2]{yu} and thus has trivial cohomology by
Theorem \ref{langs thm}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
$\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)) \cong \HT{i}(\Gamma_n, \C)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the sequence
$$0 \rightarrow \TT^0 \rightarrow \TT \rightarrow \C \rightarrow 0.$$
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $T$ is unramified then $\HT{i}(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)) \cong \HT{i}(\Gamma_n, X_*(T))$
for all $i$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the previous corollary together with Corollary \ref{unram comps}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
If $T$ is unramified and anisotropic then $\HT{0}(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)) = 0$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since $T$ is anisotropic $\HH^0(\Gamma_n, T(K_n)) \cong X_*(T)^{\Gamma_n} = 0$.
\end{proof}

\section{Groups of type L}\label{groupsoftypeL}
We now review the theory of ``groups of type L'' due to Benedict
Gross.  For a torus $T$ over $K$, recall that the dual torus $\hat{T}$ is equipped with
an action of $\Gamma$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{group of type L} is a group extension of $\Gamma$ by $\hat{T}$.
\end{definition}

For such a group $D$ we have by definition an exact sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \hat{T} \rightarrow D \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow 1.$$

We now describe how, given a Langlands parameter
$$\varphi : W_K \rightarrow D,$$
where $D$ is a group of type L, we can naturally attach a character of
$T(L)_{\Gamma} := T(L) / I_{\Gamma}(T(L))$, where
$I_{\Gamma}(T(L)) = \{(1 - \sigma)t \ : t \in T(L), \sigma \in \Gamma \}$.
Restricting $\varphi$ to $W_L$ we get a homomorphism
$$\varphi|_{W_L} : W_L \rightarrow \hat{T}.$$
By the Langlands correspondence for tori, this gives us a character
$\chi : T(L) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$.  Since $\varphi|_{W_L}$ extends
to $\varphi$, one can see that
$$\chi(t^{\sigma}) = \chi(t)\ \mbox{for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.}$$
Therefore, $\chi(t^{\sigma - 1}) = 1$ for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.
Thus, $\chi$ is trivial on the augmentation ideal $I_{\Gamma}(T(L))$
and gives $$\chi : T(L)_\Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$$ Invariants
and coinvariants are related by the norm map
$$\Nm : T(L) \rightarrow T(K)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the Tate cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(L)) \rightarrow T(L)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(K)
  = T(L)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(L)) \rightarrow 1$$
(note that the norm map $\Nm$ factors to $T(L)_{\Gamma}$).
We have thus constructed a character $\chi$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$ from a
Langlands parameter $\varphi$. We note that $T(L)_{\Gamma}$ is a cover of
$\Nm(T(L)_{\Gamma})$, which is a subgroup of $T(K)$.  It is sometimes
the case that $\Nm$ is surjective, in which case $\chi$ is then a
character of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$, which is a cover of $T(K)$.

We now give meaning to the definition of \emph{admissible pair} in the introduction.

\begin{lemma}\label{weylgroups}
Let $G$ be a connected reductive $K$-group and let $T$ be a maximal
$K$-torus of $G$.  Let $L$ be the splitting field of $T$, and set
$\Gamma = \Gal(L/K)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $N(G(L), T(K)) / T(L) \cong (N(G,T)/T)(K)$.
\item The standard action of $N(G(L),T(L)) / T(L)$ on $T(L)$ determines
well-defined actions of $N(G(L), T(L))^{\Gamma} / T(K)$ and $(N(G,T)/T)(K)$
on $T(L)$, which factor naturally to actions on $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See \cite{adrianlansky}.
\end{proof}

We will need the following structural result about Langlands
parameters mapping to groups of type $L$ later.  First let $L,K,T,\hat{T}, \Gamma$
be as above, with $L/K$ unramified.  Let $\varphi_1 : W_K \rightarrow D$
be a Langlands parameter mapping to a group of type $L$.  $\varphi_1$
gives rise to a character $\chi_1$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.  Let $\varphi_2
: W_K \rightarrow D$ be defined by $\varphi_2|_{I_K} \equiv \varphi_1|_{I_K}$ and
$\varphi_2(\Fr) = t \varphi_1(\Fr)$ for some $t \in \hat{T}$.
$\varphi_2$ gives rise to a character $\chi_2$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{toralmodification}
$\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ have the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\Gamma$.  First note that $\Fr^n$
is a geometric Frobenius for $K_n$.
$\varphi_1(\Phi_L) = \varphi_1(\Fr)^r$, where $r$ is the
order of $\Gamma$.
Suppose $\varphi_1(\Fr) = g \in N_{{}^L G}(\hat{T})$.
Note that $g^n$ is an element in the dual torus
$\hat{T}$.

By Corollary \ref{reductiontori}, we know that
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T))$,
since $L/K$ is unramified.  Moreover,
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T)) = \ker(\Nm : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T)) / I_{\Gamma}(T(L))$.

Let $\lambda \in \ker(\Nm : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T))$.  Note that
$\lambda \in X^*(\hat{T})$.
Write $n^r = \mu \otimes z$, for some $\mu \in X_*(\hat{T})$,
$z \in \mathbb{C}^\times$.  Then $\chi_1(\lambda) = z^{\la\mu, \lambda\ra}$.

We now note that
$$(tn)^r = t ntn^{-1} n^2 t n^{-2} \cdots n^{r-1} t n^{1-r} n^r = t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t),$$
where $w$ is the Weyl group element associated to $n$.  If we write
$t = \mu' \otimes z'$, then $$t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t) = \Nm(\mu' ) \otimes z',$$
But now one checks:
We have $\chi_2(\lambda) = z^{\la\mu, \lambda\ra} (z' )^{\la\Nm(\mu'), \lambda\ra}$, and
$$\la\Nm(\mu'), \lambda\ra = \la \mu' + \sigma(\mu') + \sigma^2(\mu') + ... + \sigma^{r-1}(\mu'), \lambda\ra
  = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} \la \sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda \ra$$
Since $\la , \ra$ is Galois equivariant, $\la\sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda\ra =
\la\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)\ra$.  Thus, the sum
becomes
$$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} \la\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)\ra = \la\mu', \Nm(\lambda)\ra.$$
But $\lambda \in \ker(\Nm : X^*(\hat{T}) \rightarrow X^*(\hat{T}))$, so
$\la\mu', \Nm(\lambda)\ra = 0$.  Therefore, $\chi_2(\lambda) =
z^{\la\mu, \lambda\ra} = \chi_1(\lambda)$.
\end{proof}

\section{The relationship between the Gross construction and the DeBacker--Reeder construction}\label{grossdebackerreeder}

We consider here an RSELP $\varphi$ for any unramified connected
reductive group G.  Let $T$ be as in \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $L$,
$\chi$, etc.~be as in~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $w$ be the Weyl
group element associated to $\varphi$, and set $\sigma = w \theta\in {\rm Aut}(T)$.
Let $\chi_{\varphi}$ be the character of $T(K) = T^{\Fr}$ that
DeBacker and Reeder attach to $\varphi$.

We have the exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L)) \rightarrow T(L)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(K)
  \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(L)) \rightarrow 1$$

where $\Gamma = \Gal(L/K)$.  Recall that $\varphi$ canonically gives
rise to a character $\chi$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$, by local Langlands
for tori (see section \ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Note that the above
exact sequence restricts to an exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\OL)) \rightarrow T(\OL)_{\Gamma}
  \rightarrow T(\OK) \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\OL)) \rightarrow 1$$

Moreover, by Lemmas \ref{H1compactpart} and \ref{H0compactpart}, we have
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\OL)) = \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\OL)) = 1$.
Therefore, the map
$$T(\OL)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(\OK)$$
is an isomorphism, and we may view
$\chi|_{T(\OL)_{\Gamma}}$ as a character of
$T(\OK)$ via this isomorphism.  Now, since $\chi$ was
obtained from $\varphi|_{W_L}$ via the local Langlands correspondence, one can see
from the constructions in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder} that
$\chi_{\varphi} \circ \Nm = \chi$ on $T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$ (one can see
\cite{adrianlansky} for more details on the constructions of
\cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder} and their relationship to groups of
type $L$).
We have therefore proven the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}
  The restriction to $T(\OL)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\sim} T(\OK)$
  of the genuine character arising from the Gross construction
  coincides with the character of $T(\OK)$ that is
  constructed from $\varphi$ via the construction of DeBacker--Reeder
  construction.
\end{lemma}

\section{Rectifiers and DeBacker/Reeder}\label{mainresults}

Recall that we have fixed a splitting $(\hat{T}, \hat{B}, \{x_{\alpha} \})$
for the dual group $\hat{G}$ and that $\hat{N} = N_{\hat{G}}(\hat{T})$.
For each simple root $\alpha$, let $\phi_{\alpha} : SL(2) \rightarrow \hat{G}$
be defined by $\phi_{\alpha}(\mathrm{diag}(z,1/z)) = \alpha^{\vee}(z)$
and $\phi_{\alpha}\mat{1}{1}{0}{1} = x_{\alpha}$. Let
$\sigma_{\alpha} = \phi_{\alpha}\mat{0}{1}{-1}{0}$.

\begin{definition}
  The Tits group $\widetilde{W}$ is the subgroup of $\hat{N}$
  generated by $\{\sigma_{\alpha} \}$ for $\alpha$ simple.
\end{definition}

For each simple root $\alpha$, let $m_{\alpha} = \sigma_{\alpha}^2 = \alpha^{\vee}(-1)$.
Let $\hat{T}_2$ be the subgroup of $\hat{T}$ generated by the $m_{\alpha}$.

\begin{theorem}{(Tits \cite{tits})}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The kernel of the natural map $\widetilde{W_o} \rightarrow \hat{W}_o$
  is $\hat{T}_2$,
\item The elements $\sigma_{\alpha}$ satisfy the braid relations,
\item There is a canonical lifting of $\hat{W}_o$ to a subset of
  $\widetilde{W}$: take a reduced expression $w = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$,
  and let $\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} ... \sigma_{\alpha_n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Let $\varphi$ be a RSELP.  Then $\varphi(I_K) \subset \hat{T}$ and
$\varphi(\Fr) = \hat{\theta} f$ for some $f \in \hat{N}$.  Let $\hat{w}$
be the image of $f$ in $\hat{W}_o$, and let $w$ be the element of
$W_o$ corresponding to $\hat{w}$.  Write $\hat{w} = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$
as a product of simple reflections, and let
$\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} \cdots \sigma_{\alpha_n}$ be the \MAxxx{the?  Is there
a canonical lift?}
canonical lift of $\hat{w}$ to $\widetilde{W}$.

\begin{definition}
Given $\varphi$, we define a homomorphism $\varphi_o : W_K \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varphi_o|_{I_K} \equiv 1$
\item $\varphi_o(\Fr) = \hat{\theta} \tilde{w}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

By the theory in section \ref{preliminaries}, $\varphi$ and $\varphi_o$ give
rise to a character $\chi_{\varphi}$ and $\chi_{\varphi_o}$ of
$T(K) = T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$, respectively.  By the theory in section
\ref{groupsoftypeL}, $\varphi$ and $\varphi_o$ gives rise to characters
$\xi_{\varphi}$ and $\xi_{\varphi_o}$ of $T(L)_{\Gamma}$, respectively.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is semisimple, then $\xi_{\varphi} \otimes \xi_{\varphi_o}^{-1} = \chi_{\varphi}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $G$ is semisimple, $T(K)$ is compact.  In particular,
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(L)) = 0$ by Corollary \ref{trivialh0compacttori},
so we have the following exact sequence:
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L)) \rightarrow T(L)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(K) \rightarrow 1$$
Note that $T(K) = T(\OK)$, and so in particular
$T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$ surjects onto $T(K)$ via the norm map
$\Nm$.  This, together with the fact that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L)) \neq 0$,
gives us that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(L))$ and
$T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$ together generate $T(L)_{\Gamma}$.

Since $\varphi_o|_{I_K} \equiv 1$, $\xi_{\varphi_o}$ is trivial on
$T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$.  By lemma
\ref{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}, we have that
$(\xi_{\varphi} \otimes \xi_{\varphi_o}^{-1})|_{T(\OL)_{\Gamma}} = \chi_{\varphi}|_{T(\OK)}$.
Therefore, $\xi_{\varphi} \otimes \xi_{\varphi_o}^{-1}$ is correct on
$T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$.  Moreover, by Lemma
\ref{toralmodification}, we also have that $\xi_{\varphi}$ and $\xi_{\varphi_o}$ have
the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(L))$.  Therefore,
$\xi_{\varphi} \otimes \xi_{\varphi_o}^{-1}$ is a character of $T(K)$.  Since
$\xi_{\varphi} \otimes \xi_{\varphi_o}^{-1}$ is correct on $T(\OL)_{\Gamma}$, and
since $T(\OL)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\Nm} T(K)$ is surjective,
we are done.
\end{proof}

In the case that $G$ is semisimple, there was nothing special about
$\varphi_o$.  In fact, by the same arguments, $\xi_{\varphi_o} = \xi_{\varphi'}$
for any Langlands parameter $\varphi'$ such that $\varphi'|_{I_K} \equiv 1$
and $\varphi'(\Fr) = w'$, where $w'$ was any lift of $\hat{w}$ to $N$.
However, we will see that the \MAxxx{the Tits group lift or a Tits group
 lift?} Tits group lift is forced on us when we
consider groups that are not necessarily semisimple, such as $GL(n,K)$.

\section{Rectifiers for $GL(n,K)$}\label{GL(n)}

We first recall the structure of the rectifiers for $GL(n,K)$ in our
setting (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}).

\begin{lemma}\label{rectifierofbushnellhenniart}
  Suppose that $(L/K, \xi)$ is an admissible pair such that $L/K$ is
  unramified of degree $n$ and $\xi|_{\OL} \equiv 1$.
  Then ${}_K \mu_{\xi}$ is unramified and
  ${}_K \mu_{\xi}(\varpi_L) = (-1)^{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See \cite[Proposition 21]{bushnellhenniart}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, X_*(T)) = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
As $T = Res_{L/K}(\Gm)$, $\Gamma$ acts on $X_*(T)$ by cyclic shift.
Therefore, $X_*(T)^{\Gamma} = \mathbb{Z}$, embedded diagonally in
$\mathbb{Z}^n$.  Note that $\Nm(1,0,0,\cdots,0) = (1,1,\cdots,1)$, so
$X_*(T)^{\Gamma} \subset \Nm(X_*(T))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T)) = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
$(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \in \ker(\Nm)$ if and only if $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 0$.
It is then easy to see that $\ker(\Nm)$ is generated by $e_i - e_j$ for $i < j$, where
$e_i$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{Z}^n$.  But $e_i - e_j = (1-\sigma^{j-i}) e_i$,
where $\sigma$ is the element of $\Gamma$ that cyclically shifts to the right by
one space.  Thus $\ker(\Nm) \subset I_{\Gamma}(X_*(T))$.
\end{proof}

The Tate cohomology exact sequence therefore reduces to
$$1 \rightarrow T(L)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\sim} T(K) \rightarrow 1$$
\begin{proposition}\label{powersoflifts}
Let $\hat{w} = s_{\alpha_1} s_{\alpha_2} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$ where
$s_{\alpha_i}$ are the simple reflections of $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$,
for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.  Then $\tilde{w}^n = (-Id)^{n-1}$, where $Id$
denotes the identity element in $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
See \cite[\S3.1]{zaremsky}.
\end{proof}

Since $\Fr^n$ is a geometric Frobenius for $L$ and thus corresponds to $\varpi_L$ under local
class field theory, we obtain

\begin{corollary}\label{agreemenetofrectifiers}
$\xi_{\varphi_o} = {}_K \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Note that $T(L) = L^{\times} \times L^{\times} \times \cdots \times L^{\times}$, and
that $T(K) = (w, \sigma(w), \sigma^2(w), \cdots, \sigma^{n-1}(w))$, where 
$Gal(L/K) = \langle \sigma \rangle$.  A uniformizer $\varpi_L$ in $L^{\times}$ 
therefore corresponds to $(\varpi_L, \varpi_L, \cdots, \varpi_L) \in T(K)$, whose 
preimage under $\Nm$ is the class of $(\varpi_L, 1, 1, \cdots, 1) \in T(L)_{\Gamma}$.
The local Langlands correpondence for tori says now that 
$\xi_{\varphi_o}(\varpi_L) = (-1)^{n-1}$, because of Proposition \ref{powersoflifts}.
\end{proof}

We end this section by explaining why the Tits group lift of $w$ is forced upon us.
We may look no further than $G = GL(2)$.  Suppose we define
$\varphi_o' : W_K \rightarrow GL(2,\mathbb{C})$ by $\varphi_o'|_{I_K} \equiv 1$ and

\[
\varphi_o'(\Fr) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
0 & a\\
b & 0
\end{array} \right)
\]

We may conjugate $\varphi_o'$ so that

\[
\varphi_o'(\Fr) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
b & 0
\end{array} \right)
\]

for some $b \in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$.  One can see that, by analogous arguments 
as in Corollary \ref{agreementofrectifiers}
$\xi_{\varphi_o'}(\varpi_L) = b$.  By Lemma \ref{rectifierofbushnellhenniart}, we are 
forced to have $b = -1$.
