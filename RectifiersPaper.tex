In this paper we propose a natural generalization of rectifiers, the
character twists that appear in the local Langlands correspondence for
$GL(n,F)$.  Our generalization is to arbitrary connected reductive
groups, with certain classes of Langlands parameters.

\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of the notion of a
rectifier.  In particular, we define rectifiers for Langlands
parameters of arbitrary connected reductive groups that map into a
``group of type L''.  We then describe these rectifiers via their
associated Langlands parameters, and show that they are compatible
with the rectifiers of $GL(n,F)$ as in \cite{bushnellhenniart}.

An irreducible smooth representation of the Weil group $W_F$ of $F$ is
called \emph{essentially tame} if its restriction to wild inertia is a
sum of characters.  Let us recall the classical construction of the
essentially tame local Langlands correspondence for $GL(n,F)$.  In the
essentially tame case, an irreducible representation $\varphi : W_F
\rightarrow GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ naturally provides an \emph{admissible
  pair} $(E/F, \xi)$.  Here, $E/F$ is a degree $n$ separable extension
and $\xi$ is a character (with certain conditions) of $E^{\times}$,
which one can view as a maximal elliptic torus in $GL(n,F)$.  Howe
constructs a map (see \cite{howe})
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
isomorphism \ classes \ of \\
admissible \ pairs
\end{array}
\right\} \rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
supercuspidal \ representations \\
of \ GL(n,F)
\end{array} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$\hspace{-.5in} (E/F, \xi) \mapsto \pi_{\xi}$$
The problem is that the obvious map, $$\varphi \mapsto \pi_{\xi},$$
the so-called ``naive correspondence'', is not the local Langlands
correspondence because $\pi_{\xi}$ has the wrong central character.
Instead, the local Langlands correspondence is given by $$\varphi
\mapsto \pi_{\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi}}$$ for some subtle finite order
character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ of $E^{\times}$.  The function $${}_F
\boldsymbol\mu : (E/F, \xi) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ is called the
\emph{rectifier} associated to $E/F$.  Both the description of and the
intuition behind the rectifiers ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu$ have been
studied (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}, \cite{geo}, \cite{adrian}).

One may ask whether rectifiers exist for groups apart from $GL(n,F)$,
and even moreso, how does one define the notion of rectifier for
groups apart from $GL(n,F)$.  The answer can be gleamed from a recent
construction of Benedict Gross, which we briefly describe now (for
more details, see \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).

Suppose that $G$ is a connected reductive group defined over a
$p$-adic field $F$.  Let $\phi : W_F \rightarrow {}^L G$ be a
Langlands parameter for $G(F)$, and suppose that $\phi$ factors
through the normalizer of a maximal torus. To $\phi$, one can
associate a maximal $F$-torus $T$ in $G$, the twisted $F$-torus
associated to $\phi(\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is the geometric Frobenius
\MAxxx{geometric or arithmetic?  does it even make sense to say ``the
  geometric Frobenius of $W_F$''?} of $W_F$.  Suppose that $T$ splits
over the Galois extension $E$ of $F$, and set $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.
Restricting $\phi$ to $W_E$, by the local Langlands correspondence for
tori, one can canonically associate to $\phi$ a character $\xi_{\phi}$
of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, the group of coinvariants of $T(E)$ with respect
to $\Gamma$ (see~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Invariants and coinvariants
are related by the norm map
$$N : T(E) \rightarrow T(F)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{N} T(F)
= T(E)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow 1,$$
where $\hat{H}$denotes Tate cohomology.

Suppose that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$, in which case
$T(E)_{\Gamma}$ is then a cover of $T(F)$.  Let us also suppose that
$\phi$ does not factor through a proper Levi subgroup, so that the
representations in the $L$-packet associated to $\phi$ are
conjecturally all supercuspidal (see \cite[\S 3.5]{debackerreeder}).
If $G$ happens to be $GL(n)$, one can compute that
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$, so that
$T(E)_{\Gamma} \cong T(F)$ can be identified with $E^{\times}$, and
$(E/F, \xi)$ is an admissible pair.  To construct the local Langlands
correspondence, one would then proceed (as explained earlier) to
attach the supercuspidal representation $\pi_{\xi \cdot {}_F
  \mu_{\xi}}$ to $\xi$, via the construction of Howe.

If $G$ were arbitrary, then in analogy to the case of $GL(n,F)$, there
exist in certain cases constructions of supercuspidal $L$-packets
$L(\xi)$ associated to characters $\xi$ of tori $T(F)$ in $G(F)$ (see
\cite{debackerreeder}, \cite{kaletha}, \cite{reeder}).  However, as we
have seen, a Langlands parameter $\phi$ as above does not naturally
provide a character of $T(F)$, but rather a character of
$T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $F$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $E$.  Suppose $\xi$ is a character of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.
The pair $(T, \xi)$ is called \emph{admissible} if $\xi$ is not fixed
by any element of $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$ (see Lemma \ref{weylgroups}).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{rectifierdefinition}
  Let $T$ be a torus, defined over $F$, that splits over an unramified
  extension $E$.  A \emph{rectifier} for $T$ is a function $${}_F
  \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi)$, a character ${}_F
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(F)}$

\item The character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is tamely ramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(1 + \mathfrak{p}_E)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\phi \mapsto L(\xi_{\phi} \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi_{\phi}})$
  is the local Langlands correspondence.

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is tamely ramified, then
${}_F \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_F \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
  Let $T$ be as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.  Then $T$
  admits a unique rectifier ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu : (T, \xi) \mapsto
  {}_F \mu_{\xi}$.\MAxxx{Should we assume that the Langlands parameters
  are ``regular''?  Since this is what we know for LLC.  Then we might
  as well assume that the rectifiers are unramified as well.}
\end{conjecture}

As the local Langlands correspondence is not known in general, we must restrict
ourselves to cases where supercuspidal $L$-packets have been constructed.
Since we are in the present paper considering the situation when $T$ is unramified,
we consider those $L$-packets constructed in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.
We will show that the characters ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ that arise in this setting
are actually unramified (i.e. trivial on $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$).  In particular, 
the setting
of \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder} do not include all possible admissible
pairs $(T, \xi)$.  In particular, because of condition (3) above, we cannot hope
to say anything at present about the situation where ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is ramified,
except possibly in the case where $G = GL(n)$ (note that for
$G = GL(n)$, ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ can be ramified even if $T$ is unramified).
We return to this case in another paper.

Since $L$-packets have not been constructed in the generality that 
we need in order to prove this conjecture, we prove a theorem that 
almost proves the conjecture in its entirety.  Let $Reg(T, \xi)$ denote 
the set of admissible pairs that arise from RSELPs,
as in \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}.  We can prove:

\begin{theorem}\label{regularrectifierdefinition}
Let $G$ be semisimple, and $T$ as in Definition \ref{rectifierdefinition}.
There exists a unique function $${}_F
  \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}} : Reg(T, \xi) \mapsto {}_F \mu_{\xi}$$ which attaches,
  to each admissible pair $(T, \xi) \in Reg(T,\xi)$, a character ${}_F
  \mu_{\xi}$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ satisfying the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\xi \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi} \in \widehat{T(F)}$

\item The character ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$ is unramified (i.e. trivial on
  $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$)

\item $\phi \mapsto L(\xi_{\phi} \cdot {}_F \mu_{\xi_{\phi}})$
  agrees with \cite{debackerreeder} and \cite{reeder}

\item If $(T, \xi_i), i = 1,2$ are admissible pairs  such that
$\xi_1^{-1} \xi_2$ is unramified, then
${}_F \mu_{\xi_1} = {}_F \mu_{\xi_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Once phrased in this manner, uniqueness is a straightforward matter
(see \S\ref{}) \MAxxx{Fix when we can.}.

As explained earlier, this is all that we can hope to do,
as more general $L$-packets in the case of $T$ unramified have not been
constructed.  Once $L$-packets are constructed more generally, we hope to
construct the rectifier in general.  The existence of this function
will be proven by interpreting the characters ${}_F \mu_{\xi}$
in terms of a canonical Langlands parameter.  More explicitly,
we will exhibit a canonical
\MAxxx{Canonical?  Is the Tits group lift canonical?} Langlands
parameter $\phi_{o}$, such that if $\xi_o = \xi_{\phi_o}$, then the
function $$(T, \xi) \mapsto \xi_o$$ is satisfies conditions (1)-(4).

Let $\phi, T, E, \xi$ as before, assuming that $\phi$ is RSELP.
The projection of $\phi(\Phi)$ onto the connected component of ${}^L
G$ is a lift of some Weyl group element $\hat{w}$ to the normalizer of
the dual torus.  Associated to $\phi$, DeBacker/Reeder construct a
character $\chi_{\phi}$ of $T(F)$, to which they associate a
conjectural $L$-packet of representations $L(\chi_{\phi})$ (see \S
\ref{preliminaries}).

\begin{definition}
Given $\phi$, we define a homomorphism $\phi_o : W_F \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi_o|_{I_F} \equiv 1$
\item $\phi_o(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} \tilde{w}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

where $\hat{\theta}$ is the geometric
\MAxxx{geometric or arithmetic? or neither?}
Frobenius element generating the action of Galois on
the dual group, and where $\tilde{w}$ is the canonical lift
\MAxxx{Is this lift really canonical?}
of $\hat{w}$ to the Tits group (see \S\ref{mainresults}).
Let $\xi_o = \xi_{\phi_o}$.  Our main theorem is the following.

\begin{theorem}
  If $G$ is semisimple, then $$(T, \xi) \mapsto
  \xi_o$$ satisfies conditions (1)-(4) of Definition \ref{regularrectifierdefinition}.
\end{theorem}

Therefore, we have may uniquely define 
${}_F \boldsymbol\mu^{\mathrm{Reg}}(T,\xi) 
:= \xi_o \ \forall (T,\xi) \in Reg(T,\xi)$

In the case that $G$ is semisimple, there was nothing special about
$\phi_o$.  In fact, by the same arguments that we will make, a
rectifier is obtained from any Langlands parameter $\phi'$ such that
$\phi'|_{I_F} \equiv 1$ and $\phi'(\Phi) = w'$, where $w'$ was any
lift of $\hat{w}$ to the normalizer of the dual torus.  However, the
following theorem (which we will prove) will show that $\phi_o$ is
forced upon us.
\MAxxx{Up to a sign, or something like that?}

\begin{theorem}
  If $G = GL(n,F)$, the character ${}_F \boldsymbol\mu$ agrees with
  the rectifier of Bushnell/Henniart.  Moreover, $\phi_o$ is the
  unique \MAxxx{up to a sign, or something like that} Langlands
  parameter such that $\xi_{\phi_o} = {}_F \mu_{\xi}$.
\end{theorem}\MAxxx{This theorem is false, because our rectifier is unramified, but theirs can be ramified.
So when we define $\phi_o$, say that this is a definition in the case of maybe regular Langlands parameters
(where regular is condition 2 in Reeder's positive depth paper...probably we need some other conditions on
our Langlands parameters, like maybe conditions 1 and 3 of Reeder's positive depth paper), or something like
that. It's clearly not a definition for all rectifiers of unramified tori. Just in the case of at least
DeBacker/Reeder and Reeder}

We would like to note that in the case that $\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E))
\neq 0$, the situation seems more difficult $\xi$ is defined on the
image of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ under the norm map.  However, one might be
able to remedy this with a prediction of central character, as in
\cite{grossreeder}, for example.

\section{Notation and Definitions}

Throughout, $\mathfrak{f}$ will denote a finite field, and
$\mathfrak{f}_n$ will denote the degree $n$ extension of
$\mathfrak{f}$.  $k$ will denote a nonarchimedean local field of
charcteristic zero, and $\mathfrak{f}$ will be its residue field.  Fix
a uniformizer $\varpi$ of $k$.  Let $k^u$ denote the maximal
unramified extension of $k$, and fix a valuation $\val : (k^u)^\times
\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ normalized so that $\val(\varpi) = 1$.

\section{Preliminaries}

If $S$ is a torus that is defined over an arbitrary field $F$ and
$E/F$ is a Galois extension, then we have the norm map
$$N_{E/F} : S(E) \rightarrow S(F)$$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ s \mapsto
\prod_{\sigma \in \Gal(E/F)} \sigma(s)$$

\section{Tori over finite fields}

Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a torus that is defined over a finite field
$\mathfrak{f}$.  Suppose $\mathbb{T}$ splits over an extension
$\mathfrak{f}_n$ and set $G_n := \Gal(\mathfrak{f}_n/\mathfrak{f})$.
We wish to compute $\HT{i}(G_n,\mathbb{T}(\mathfrak{f}_n))$.
Recall that, since $G_n$ is cyclic, $\HT{i}(G_n,A)\cong
\HT{i+2}(G_n,A)$ for all $i$, and all $G_n$-modules $A$.

\begin{proposition}\label{trivialH1finitefields}
$\HT{1}(G_n,\mathbb{T}(\mathfrak{f}_n))$ is trivial.
\end{proposition}

\proof
This is Lang's theorem for connected algebraic groups over finite fields.
\qed

\begin{corollary}
$\HT{0}(G_n,\mathbb{T}(\mathfrak{f}_n))$ is trivial.
\end{corollary}

\proof
It is well-known
\DRxxx{add a reference}
that the Herbrand quotient of a finite group is trivial.  Hence, the result follows.
\qed

\section{Unramified Tori over p-adic fields}

Let $T$ be a torus defined over $k$ that splits over an unramified
extension $K/k$ of degree $n$, set $G := \Gal(K/k)$, and let $g$ be a
generator of $G$.  Recall that, since $G$ is cyclic,
$\HT{i}(G,A)\cong \HT{i+2}(G,A)$ for all $i$, and all
$G$-modules $A$.  Let $X$ denote the cocharacter lattice of $T$ and
$Y$ denote the character lattice of $T$.  As in \cite[Section 3]{moyprasad1},
we define $T_0$ to be the maximal bounded subgroup of
$T(k^u)$, and
$$T_r := \{t \in T_0 : \val(\chi(t) - 1) \geq r \ \ \forall \chi \in Y \}$$
for any natural number $r$.  We may
furthermore define $T_r^L := T_r \cap T(L)$ for any field $L$ such
that $k \subset L \subset k^u$.  We wish to compute $\HT{i}(G, T(K))$.
We use the filtration $T_r^K$ on $T(K)$ in the following way.

It is clear that $N_{K/k}$ maps $T_r^K$ into $T_r^k$ for all $r \geq 0$.
Therefore, we get an induced map
$$N_{K/k} : T_s^K / T_{r}^K \rightarrow T_s^k / T_{r}^k$$
for all $r > s \geq 0$.

\begin{lemma}\label{H1compactpart}
$\HT{1}(G, T_{s}^K) = 0 \ \forall s \geq 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
We prove the case $s = 0$, as the other cases are similar.  Recall
that $T_0^K = \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ T_0^K / T_{r+1}^K$.  We
need the following Lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{abstractcohomology}
  Let $M$ be a $G$-module complete with respect to a topology given by
  a sequence of $G$-invariant subgroups $M = M_0 \supset M_1 \supset
  M_2 \supset ...$, so $\cap M_i = 0$.  Thus,
  $M = \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ M / M_i$.
  If $\HH^1(G, M_i / M_{i+1}) = 0 \ \forall i \geq 0$,
  then $\HH^1(G, M_j) = 0 \forall j \geq 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof

We do the case $j = 0$.  The argument for $j \geq 1$ is similar.  Let
$f : G \rightarrow M$ be an element in $\HH^1(G,M)$.  We have a natural
map $\HH^1(G, M ) \rightarrow \HH^1(G, M / M_1) = 0$.  Thus, there exists
$m_0 \in M$ such that $f(\sigma) = (\sigma(m_0) - m_0) (\mathrm{mod} \
M_1)$.  Then define $f_1 := f - (\sigma(m_0) - m_0)$.  This is in
$\HH^1(G, M_1)$. But then again we have the natural map
$\HH^1(G, M_1) \rightarrow \HH^1(G, M_1 / M_2) = 0$.  Thus, again, there
exists $m_1 \in M_1$ such that $f_1(\sigma) = (\sigma(m_1) - m_1) (\mathrm{mod} \ M_2)$.
So define $f_2 = f - (\sigma(m) - m) - (\sigma(m_1) - m_1)$.  Continue
this process indefinitely.  Then define
$\tilde{m} := (m_0, m_0 + m_1, m_0 + m_1 + m_2, m_0 + m_1 + m_2
+ m_3, \ldots) \in \underleftarrow{\mathrm{lim}} \ M / M_i = M$.  Then,
$f(\sigma) = \sigma(\tilde{m}) - \tilde{m}$, so we get finally that
$\HH^1(G,M) = 0$.  \qed

Let $r \geq 1$.  Note that $T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K = X \otimes (1 +
\mathfrak{p}_K^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K^{r+1}) = X \otimes
\mathfrak{f}_n$.  Well, $X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n$ is a vector space
over $\mathfrak{f}$.  But it is known that all forms of vector spaces
are equivalent.  Therefore, the vector space $X \otimes
\mathfrak{f}_n$ with the above Galois action is equivalent to $X
\otimes \mathfrak{f}_n$ with the standard action, i.e. $g \in G$ acts
on $x \otimes z$ by $x \otimes gz$.  Thus, we wish to calculate
$\HT{1}(G, X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n)$ where $X \otimes
\mathfrak{f}_n$ is given the standard action.  Since $X \otimes
\mathfrak{f}_n$ is just a direct sum of copies of $\mathfrak{f}_n$, we
are reduced to calculating $\HT{1}(G, \mathfrak{f}_n)$.  But since
the trace map over finite fields is surjective, we get that
$\HT{0}(G, \mathfrak{f}_n) = 0$.  Therefore, since the Herbrand
quotient of a finite group is trivial, we get that $\HT{1}(G,
\mathfrak{f}_n) = 0$.  Finally, $\HT{1}(G, T_0^K / T_1^K) = 0$ by
Lang's theorem since $T_0^K / T_1^K$ is a connected algebraic group
over a finite field.  By Lemma \ref{abstractcohomology}, we have
concluded the proof of Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}.  \qed

\begin{lemma}\label{H0compactpart}
$\HT{0}(G,T_0^K) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
We claim that the natural maps
$$N_{K/k} : T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K \rightarrow T_r^k / T_{r+1}^k$$

are surjective for $r \geq 0$.  First let $r \geq 1$.  First note that
$T_0^L = X \otimes \mathfrak{o}_L^\times$ and
$T_r^L = X \otimes (1 + \mathfrak{p}_L^r)$ for $r \geq 1$.  Then
$$N_{K/k} : T_r^K / T_{r+1}^K \rightarrow T_r^k / T_{r+1}^k$$
becomes
$$N_{K/k} : X \otimes \left( (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K^r) / (1 +
  \mathfrak{p}_K^{r+1}) \right) \rightarrow (X \otimes \left( (1 +
  \mathfrak{p}_K^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K^{r+1}) \right) )^G$$
since $T_r^k / T_{r+1}^k = T_r^G / T_{r+1}^G = (T_r / T_{r+1})^G$ since
$\HH^1(G, T_{r+1}) = 0$ by Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}.  But
$(1 + \mathfrak{p}_K^r) / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K^{r+1}) \cong \mathfrak{o}_K / \mathfrak{p}_K \cong \mathfrak{f}_n$.
Thus, we get
$$N_{K/k} : X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n \rightarrow (X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n)^G$$

Well, $X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n$ is a vector space over
$\mathfrak{f}$.  But it is known that all forms of vector spaces are
equivalent.  Therefore, the vector space $X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n$
with the above Galois action is equivalent to $X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n$
with the standard action, i.e. $g \in G$ acts on $x \otimes z$ by
$x \otimes gz$.  Therefore,
$$N_{K/k} : X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n \rightarrow (X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n)^G$$
becomes
$$N_{K/k} : X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n \rightarrow X \otimes \mathfrak{f},$$
which is surjective since the trace map $\mathfrak{f}_n \rightarrow \mathfrak{f}$
is surjective.  Now let $r = 0$.  We wish to show that
$$N_{K/k} : T_0^K / T_1^K \rightarrow T_0^k / T_1^k$$
is surjective.  But this map becomes
$$N_{K/k} : X \otimes \left( \mathfrak{o}_K^\times / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K) \right) \rightarrow (X \otimes \left( \mathfrak{o}_K^\times / (1 + \mathfrak{p}_K) \right) )^G$$
which is just
$$N_{K/k} : \mathbb{T}(\mathfrak{f}_n) \rightarrow \mathbb{T}(\mathfrak{f}).$$
This last map is surjective by Lemma \ref{normtorifinitefields}.
Finally, by \cite[Lemma 2, p. 81]{serre1}, we have our result.
\qed

\begin{corollary}\label{reductiontori}
$\HT{i}(G, X \otimes K^\times) = \HT{i}(G, T(K)) = \HT{i}(G,X_*(T))$ for $i=0,1$.
\end{corollary}

\proof

Recall that $X \otimes K^\times \xrightarrow{\sim} T(K)$ given by
evaluation, restricting to an isomorphism $X \otimes \mathfrak{o}_K^\times
\xrightarrow{\sim} T_0^K$.  We may thus identify $X$ with the quotient
$T(K) / T_0^K$, giving rise to the short exact sequence
$$1 \rightarrow T_0^K \rightarrow T(K) \rightarrow X \rightarrow 1.$$
We therefore have the long exact sequence
$$... \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T_0^K) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T(K)) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, X)
\rightarrow \HT{1}(G, T_0^K) \rightarrow $$ $$\HT{1}(G, T(K))
\rightarrow \HT{1}(G, X) \rightarrow \HT{0}(G, T_0^K)
\rightarrow ...$$
By corollary \ref{H0compactpart} and Lemma \ref{H1compactpart}, we get the result.
\qed

\begin{corollary}
If $T(k)$ is compact, we have $\HT{0}(G, T(K)) = 0$.
\end{corollary}

\proof
$T(k)$ being compact means that $X^G = 0$, hence the result follows by corollary \ref{reductiontori}
\qed

\begin{corollary}
  Let $\Phi$ be the characteristic polynomial of $g$ acting on $X$. If
  $\Phi(1)\neq 0$, i.e. $T_X(k)$ is compact, then $\HH^0(G, X\otimes
  K^{\times})=0$ and the order of $\HH^1(G, X\otimes K^{\times})$ is
  $\Phi(1)$.
\end{corollary}

\proof

Since $0 = g^n - 1 = (1 + g + g^2 + ... + g^{n-1})(g-1)$ and since $1$
is not an eigenvalue of $g$ on $X$, we get that $1 + g + g^2 + \cdots + g^{n-1}$
is the zero map on $X$.  Now, we have that
$\HH^1(G, X\otimes K^{\times}) = \HH^1(G, X) = ker(N_{K/k}) / (Id - g)X$
where $N_{K/k}$ is the norm map $N_{K/k} : X \rightarrow X$ on $X$.
Since $1 + g + g^2 + \cdots + g^{n-1}$ is the zero map on $X$,
we get that $\HH^1(G, X) = X / (Id - g)X$.  It is known by standard lattice
theory that the cardinality of $X / (Id - g)X$ is equal to the volume of
a fundamental domain for the lattice $(Id - g)X$.  It is also known that
the volume of a fundamental domain for the lattice $(Id - g)X$ is equal to
$|det(Id - g)|$.  But $|det(Id - g)|$ is just $|\Phi(1)|$.  But
$|\Phi(1)| = \Phi(1)$ for the following reason.  Note that since
$1 + g + g^2 + \cdots + g^{n-1} = 0$, $\Phi$ divides a power of
$1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1}$ (since the minimal polynomial of $g$
divides $1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{n-1}$).  Since
$1 + 1 + 1^2 + \cdots + 1^{n-1} > 0$, we have that $\Phi(1) > 0$,
so that $|\Phi(1)| = \Phi(1)$.
\qed

\section{Review of Construction of DeBacker and Reeder}\label{preliminaries}

We first review some of the basic theory from \cite{debackerreeder}.
We first fix a pinning $(\hat{T}, \hat{B}, \{x_{\alpha} \})$ for the
dual group $\hat{G}$.  The operator $\hat{\theta}$ dual to $\theta$
extends to an automorphism of $\hat{T}$.  There is a unique extension
of $\hat{\theta}$ to an automorphism of $\hat{G}$, satisfying
$\hat{\theta}(x_{\alpha}) = x_{\theta \cdot \alpha}$ (see
\cite[section 3.2]{debackerreeder}).  Following \cite{debackerreeder},
we may form the semidirect product ${}^L G := \ <\hat{\theta}> \ltimes \hat{G}$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $W_F'$ denote the Weil-Deligne group.  A Langlands parameter
  $\phi : W_F' \rightarrow {}^L G$ is called a \emph{tame regular
    semisimple elliptic Langlands parameter} (abbreviated TRSELP) if

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\phi$ is trivial on $I_F^+$,

    \item The centralizer of $\phi(I_F)$ in $\hat{G}$ is a torus.

    \item $C_{\hat{G}}(\phi)^o = (\hat{Z}^{\hat{\theta}})^o$, where $\hat{Z}$ denotes the center of $\hat{G}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Condition (2) forces $\phi$ to be trivial on $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$.  Let
$\hat{N} = N_{\hat{G}}(\hat{T})$.  After conjugating by $\hat{G}$, we
may assume that $\phi(I_F) \subset \hat{T}$ and $\phi(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} f$,
where $f \in \hat{N}$.  Let $\hat{w}$ be the image of $f$ in
$\hat{W}_o$, and let $w$ be the element of $W_o$ corresponding to $\hat{w}$.

Let $\phi$ be a TRSELP with associated $w$ and set $\sigma = w \theta$.
$\sigma$ is an automorphism of $X$.  Let $\hat{\sigma}$ be the
automorphism dual to $\sigma$, and let $n$ be the order of $\sigma$.
We set $\hat{G}_{ab} := \hat{G} / \hat{G}'$, where $\hat{G}'$ denotes
the derived group of $\hat{G}$. Let
${}^L T_{\sigma} := \langle \hat{\sigma} \rangle \ltimes \hat{T}$.
Associated to $\phi$, DeBacker--Reeder (see \cite[Chapter
4]{debackerreeder}) define a $\hat{T}$-conjugacy class of Langlands
parameters

\begin{equation}
\phi_T : W_F \rightarrow {}^L T_{\sigma} \ \label{phiT}
\end{equation}

\noindent as follows.  Set $\phi_T := \phi$ on $I_F$, and
$\phi_T(\Phi) := \hat{\sigma} \ltimes \tau$ where $\tau \in \hat{T}$
is any element whose class in $\hat{T} / (1 - \hat{\sigma}) \hat{T}$
corresponds to the image of $f$ in $\hat{G}_{ab} / (1 - \hat{\theta}) \hat{G}_{ab}$
under the bijection

\begin{equation}
\hat{T} / (1 - \hat{\sigma}) \hat{T} \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \hat{G}_{ab} / (1 - \hat{\theta}) \hat{G}_{ab} \ \label{bijectionfortau}
\end{equation}

In \cite[Chapter 4]{debackerreeder}, DeBacker and Reeder construct a
canonical bijection between $\hat{T}$-conjugacy classes of admissible
homomorphisms $\phi : W_t \rightarrow {}^L T_{\sigma}$ and depth-zero
characers of $T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$ where
$\Phi_{\sigma} := \sigma \otimes \Phi^{-1}$.  We briefly summarize
this construction. Let $\mathbb{T} := X \otimes \mathfrak{F}^\times$.
Given automorphisms $\alpha, \beta$ of abelian groups $A,B$,
respectively, let $Hom_{\alpha, \beta}(A,B)$ denote the set of
homomorphisms $f : A \rightarrow B$ such that $f \circ \alpha = \beta \circ f$.
The twisted norm map
$$N_{\sigma} : \mathbb{T}^{\Phi_{\sigma}^n} \rightarrow \mathbb{T}^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$$
given by
$N_{\sigma}(t) = t \Phi_{\sigma}(t) \Phi_{\sigma}^2(t) \cdots \Phi_{\sigma}^{n-1}(t)$
induces isomorphisms
$$\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{T}^{\Phi_{\sigma}},
  \mathbb{C}^\times) \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow}
  \mathrm{Hom}_{\Phi_{\sigma}, Id}(\mathbb{T}^{\Phi_{\sigma}^n},
  \mathbb{C}^\times) \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow}
  \mathrm{Hom}_{\Phi_{\sigma}, Id}(X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n^\times, \mathbb{C}^\times)$$
Moreover, the map $s \mapsto \chi_s$ gives an isomorphism
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{\Phi, \hat{\sigma}}(\mathfrak{f}_n^\times, \hat{T})
  \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathrm{Hom}_{\Phi_{\sigma},
  Id}(X \otimes \mathfrak{f}_n^\times, \mathbb{C}^\times)$$
where $\chi_s(\lambda \otimes a) := \lambda(s(a))$.  The canonical
projection $I_t \rightarrow \mathfrak{f}_m^\times$ induces an isomorphism
as $\Phi$-modules
$I_t / (1 - Ad (\Phi)^m)I_t \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathfrak{f}_m^\times$
where $Ad$ denotes the adjoint action.  Since $\hat{\sigma}$ has order
$n$, we have $\mathrm{Hom}_{\Phi, \hat{\sigma}}(\mathfrak{f}_n^\times,
\hat{T}) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_{Ad(\Phi), \hat{\sigma}}(I_t, \hat{T})$.
Therefore, the map $s \mapsto \chi_s$ is a canonical bijection
$$\mathrm{Hom}_{Ad(\Phi), \hat{\sigma}}(I_t, \hat{T})
  \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{T}^{\Phi_{\sigma}},
  \mathbb{C}^\times)$$
Moreover, we have an isomorphism
$${}^0T^{\Phi_{\sigma}} \times X^{\sigma} \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow}
  T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$$ $$(\gamma, \lambda) \mapsto \gamma \lambda(\varpi)$$
where ${}^0 T$ is the group of $\mathfrak{o}_{F^u}$-points of $\mathbf{T}$.

Finally, note that $\hat{T} / (1 - \hat{\sigma}) \hat{T}$ is the
character group of $X^{\sigma}$, whereby
$\tau \in \hat{T} / (1 - \hat{\sigma}) \hat{T}$ corresponds to
$\chi_{\tau} \in \mathrm{Hom}(X^{\sigma}, \mathbb{C}^\times),$ where
$\chi_{\tau}(\lambda) := \lambda(\tau)$.  Therefore, we have a
canonical bijection between $\hat{T}$-conjugacy classes of admissible
homomorphisms $\phi : W_t \rightarrow {}^L T_{\sigma}$ and depth-zero
characters

\begin{equation}
\chi_{\phi} := \chi_s \otimes \chi_{\tau} \in \mathrm{Irr}(T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}) \ \ \label{chitau}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $s := \phi|_{I_t}$, $\phi(\Phi) = \hat{\sigma} \ltimes \tau$,
and where we have inflated $\chi_s$ to ${}^0 T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$.  To
$\chi_{\phi}$, DeBacker and Reeder construct an $L$-packet of
supercuspidal representations, which we denote $L(\chi_{\phi})$.

\section{Groups of type L}\label{groupsoftypeL}
We now review the theory of ``groups of type L'' due to Benedict
Gross.  Let $F$ be a field, $F^{\mathrm s}$ a separable closure, and
$T$ a torus defined over $F$ that splits over an extension $E \subset
F^s$.  Let $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.  Let $X^*(T)$ be the character module
of $T$ and $X_*(T)$ the cocharacter module of $T$.  Define
$\hat{T} = X^*(T) \otimes \mathbb{C}^\times$.  The group $\Gamma$ acts on
$\hat{T}$ via its action on $X^*(T)$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{group of type L} is a group extension of $\Gamma$ by $\hat{T}$.
\end{definition}

Let $D$ be such a group.  Then we have an exact sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \hat{T} \rightarrow D \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow 1$$

We now describe how, given a Langlands parameter
$$\phi : W_F \rightarrow D,$$
where $D$ is a group of type L, we can naturally attach a character of
$T(E)_{\Gamma} := T(E) / I_{\Gamma}(T(E))$, where
$I_{\Gamma}(T(E)) = \{(1 - \sigma)t \ : t \in T(E), \sigma \in \Gamma \}$.
Restricting $\phi$ to $W_E$ we get a homomorphism
$$\phi|_{W_E} : W_E \rightarrow \hat{T}.$$
By the Langlands correspondence for tori, this gives us a character
$\chi : T(E) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$.  Since $\phi|_{W_E}$ extends
to $\phi$, one can see that
$$\chi(t^{\sigma}) = \chi(t)\ \mbox{for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.}$$
Therefore, $\chi(t^{\sigma - 1}) = 1$ for all $\sigma \in \Gamma$.
Thus, $\chi$ is trivial on the augmentation ideal $I_{\Gamma}(T(E))$
and gives $$\chi : T(E)_\Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times$$ Invariants
and coinvariants are related by the norm map
$$N : T(E) \rightarrow T(F)$$ $$t \mapsto \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \Gamma} \sigma(t)$$
in the Tate cohomology sequence
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{N} T(F)
  = T(E)^{\Gamma} \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma,T(E)) \rightarrow 1$$
(note that the norm map $N$ factors to $T(E)_{\Gamma}$).
We have thus constructed a character $\chi$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ from a
Langlands parameter $\phi$. We note that $T(E)_{\Gamma}$ is a cover of
$N(T(E)_{\Gamma})$, which is a subgroup of $T(F)$.  It is sometimes
the case that $N$ is surjective, in which case $\chi$ is then a
character of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, which is a cover of $T(F)$.

We now give meaning to the definition of \emph{admissible pair} in the introduction.

\begin{lemma}\label{weylgroups}
Let $G$ be a connected reductive $F$-group and let $T$ be a maximal
$F$-torus of $G$.  Let $E$ be the splitting field of $T$, and set
$\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E) \cong (N(G,T)/T)(F)$.
\item The standard action of $N(G(E),T(E)) / T(E)$ on $T(E)$ determines
well-defined actions of $N(G(E), T(E))^{\Gamma} / T(F)$ and $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$
on $T(E)$, which factor naturally to actions on $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\proof
We first prove (1).  Let $nT(E)\in N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E)$.  Let $t\in T(F)$.
Then $ntn^{-1}\in T(F)$, so for $\gamma\in\Gamma$,
$\gamma(n)t\gamma(n)^{-1} =  \gamma (ntn^{-1}) = ntn^{-1}$.
Thus $n^{-1}\gamma(n)$ centralizes $T(F)$, hence centralizes the centralizer
of $T(F)$ in $G(E)$, which is $T(E)$. Thus $n^{-1}\gamma(n)\in T(E)$ so
$\gamma(n T(E)) = \gamma (n) T(E) = n T(E)$. Thus the elements of
$N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E)$ are $\Gamma$-fixed, so
$N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E) \subset (N(G,T)/T)(F)$.

Conversely, since $T$ splits over $E$, any coset in $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$
has a representative in the normalizer $N(G(E), T(E))$. Then $\gamma(n) = nt'$
for some $t'\in T(E)$ since $nT$ is $F$-rational.  Let $t\in T(F)$.
Then for $\gamma\in\Gamma$,
$\gamma(ntn^{-1}) = \gamma(n) t \gamma(n)^{-1} = (nt')t(nt')^{-1} = ntn^{-1}$.
Thus $ntn^{-1}\in T(F)$, so $n\in N(G(E),T(F))$, as desired.

We now prove (2).
The group $N(G(E), T(E))^{\Gamma} / T(F)$ embeds naturally in $(N(G,T)/T)(F)$.
Thus it suffices to to prove the statement for
$(N(G,T)/T)(F) = N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E)$.  Let $n \in N(G(E),T(F))$.  Then since $n$
normalizes $T(F)$, $n$ also normalizes $T(E)$.  Therefore, we have that
$N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E)$ acts on $T(E)$.

We now have to show that $N(G(E), T(F)) / T(E)$
sends the augmentation ideal
$\{ t\sigma(t)^{-1} : t \in T(E), \sigma \in \Gamma \}$ to itself.
Let $t \in T(E), \sigma \in \Gamma$ and let $w \in  (N(G,T)/T)(F)$.  Then $$w\left(\frac{t}{\sigma(t)}\right)
= \frac{wt}{w \sigma(t)} = \frac{w(t)}{\sigma (\sigma^{-1}(w(\sigma(t))))} =
\frac{wt}{\sigma ({}^{\sigma^{-1}} w) (t)} = \frac{wt}{\sigma(wt)},$$
the last equality coming from the fact that $w \in (N(G,T)/T)(F)$, so $w$
is fixed by $\Gamma$.
\qed

We will need the following structural result about Langlands
parameters mapping to groups of type $L$ later.  First let $E,F,T,\hat{T}$
be as above, with $E/F$ unramified.  Let $\varphi_1 : W_F \rightarrow D$
be a Langlands parameter mapping to a group of type $L$.  $\varphi_1$
gives rise to a character $\chi_1$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.  Let $\varphi_2
: W_F \rightarrow D$ be defined with the only condition that
$\varphi_2(\Phi_F) = t \varphi_1(\Phi_F)$ for some $t \in \hat{T}$.
$\varphi_2$ gives rise to a character $\chi_2$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{toralmodification}
$\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ have the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
I want to explicitly describe the character $\chi$ restricted to
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$ that is attached to a Langlands parameter
$\phi$.  Here, $T$ is defined over $F$, splits over unramified $E$,
where the degree of $E/F$ is $r$.  Let $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$, generated
by an element $\sigma$.

We restrict $\phi$ to $W_E$.  Then $\phi(Frob_E) = \phi(Frob_F)^r$.
Suppose $\phi(Frob_F) = n$, where $n$ is an element of the normalizer
of the dual torus.  Then $n^r$ is an element in the dual torus
$\hat{T}$.

What is $\chi$ restricted to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$?  Well, by
stuff that Gordan and I did, and stuff that you have probably done as
well, we know that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T))$,
since $E/F$ is unramified.  This latter group is some quotient of
$ker(N : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T))$, where $ker$ denotes kernel, and
$N$ denotes norm.

Let's describe $\chi$ on $\HT{-1}$.  Well, let
$\lambda \in ker(N : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T))$.  Let us think of
$\lambda$ as living in $X^*(\hat{T})$ instead.

Write $n^r = \mu \otimes z$, for some $\mu \in X_*(\hat{T})$ and
$z \in \mathbb{C}^\times$.  What is $\chi(\lambda)$?  Most likely it is
just $z^{<\mu, \lambda>}$ (where $< , >$ denotes the canonical pairing
on $X_*(\hat{T}) \times X^*(\hat{T})$ ).

Now let's modify our Langlands parameter.  Suppose
$\phi'(Frob_F) = tn$, for some element $t \in \hat{T}$, and suppose
$\phi'$ has the same restriction to inertia as $\phi$.  Then we get an
associated $\chi'$.  What is $\chi'$ restricted to
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) = \HT{-1}(\Gamma, X_*(T))$?

Well, let $\lambda \in ker(N : X_*(T) \rightarrow X_*(T))$.  Let us
think of $\lambda$ as living in $X^*(\hat{T})$ instead.  We need to
compute $(tn)^r$.  This is $t ntn^{-1} n^2 t n^{-2} \cdots n^{r-1} t n^{1-r} n^r$.

But $t ntn^{-1} n^2 t n^{-2} \cdots n^{r-1} t n^{1-r} = t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t)$,
where $w$ is the Weyl group element associated to $n$.  If we write
$t = \mu' \otimes z'$, then $t w(t) w^2(t) \cdots w^{r-1}(t) = N(\mu' ) \otimes z'$,
since $w$ acts as Galois on the character lattices, and since Galois
acts holomorphically on the dual group rather than antiholomorphically
(i.e. Galois acts trivially on $\mathbb{C}^\times$).  But now one checks:
We have $\chi'(\lambda) = z^{<\mu, \lambda>} (z' )^{<N(\mu'), \lambda>}$.  But

$$<N(\mu'), \lambda> = < \mu' + \sigma(\mu') + \sigma^2(\mu') + ... + \sigma^{r-1}(\mu'), \lambda>
  = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} < \sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda >$$

Since $< , >$ is Galois equivariant, $<\sigma^i(\mu'), \lambda> =
<\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)>$.  Thus, the sum
becomes
$$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} <\mu', \sigma^{-i}(\lambda)> = <\mu', N(\lambda)>.$$

But $\lambda$ is assumed to be in the kernel of the norm map!  So we
get $<\mu', N(\lambda)> = <\mu', 0> = 0$.  So
$\chi'(\lambda) = z^{<\mu, \lambda>} = \chi(\lambda)$.  Done.
\qed

\section{The relationship between the Gross construction and the DeBacker--Reeder construction}\label{grossdebackerreeder}

We consider here a TRSELP $\phi$ for any unramified connected
reductive group G.  Let $T$ be as in \S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $E$,
$\chi$, etc.~be as in~\S\ref{groupsoftypeL}.  Let $w$ be the Weyl
group element associated to $\phi$, and set $\sigma = w \theta\in {\rm Aut}(T)$.
Let $\chi_{\phi}$ be the character of $T(F) = T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$ that
DeBacker and Reeder attach to $\phi$ (see section
\ref{preliminaries}).

We have the exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(F)
  \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow 1$$

where $\Gamma = \Gal(E/F)$.  Recall that $\phi$ canonically gives
rise to a character $\chi$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, by local Langlands
for tori (see section \ref{groupsoftypeL}).  Note that the above
exact sequence restricts to an exact sequence

$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\mathfrak{o}_E)) \rightarrow T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}
  \rightarrow T(\mathfrak{o}_F) \rightarrow \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\mathfrak{o}_E)) \rightarrow 1$$

Moreover, one can show using a profinite version of Lang's theorem and
various results about tori over finite fields, that since $T$ is unramified,
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(\mathfrak{o}_E)) = \HT{0}(\Gamma, T(\mathfrak{o}_E)) = 1$.
Therefore, the map
$$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{N} T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$$
is an isomorphism, and we may view
$\chi|_{T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}}$ as a character of
$T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$ via this isomorphism.  Now, since $\chi$ was
obtained from $\phi|_{W_E}$ via the local Langlands correspondence, we
get that $\chi_{\phi} \circ N = \chi$ on $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$.
We have therefore proven the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}
  The restriction to $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{\sim} T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$
  of the genuine character arising from the Gross construction
  coincides with the character of $T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$ that is
  constructed from $\phi$ via the construction of DeBacker--Reeder
  construction.
\end{lemma}

\section{Rectifiers and DeBacker/Reeder}\label{mainresults}

Recall that we have fixed a splitting $(\hat{T}, \hat{B}, \{x_{\alpha} \})$
for the dual group $\hat{G}$ and that $\hat{N} = N_{\hat{G}}(\hat{T})$.
For each simple root $\alpha$, let $\phi_{\alpha} : SL(2) \rightarrow \hat{G}$
be defined by $\phi_{\alpha}(\mathrm{diag}(z,1/z)) = \alpha^{\vee}(z)$
and $\phi_{\alpha}\mat{1}{1}{0}{1} = x_{\alpha}$. Let
$\sigma_{\alpha} = \phi_{\alpha}\mat{0}{1}{-1}{0}$.

\begin{definition}
  The Tits group $\widetilde{W}$ is the subgroup of $\hat{N}$
  generated by $\{\sigma_{\alpha} \}$ for $\alpha$ simple.
\end{definition}

For each simple root $\alpha$, let $m_{\alpha} = \sigma_{\alpha}^2 = \alpha^{\vee}(-1)$.
Let $\hat{T}_2$ be the subgroup of $\hat{T}$ generated by the $m_{\alpha}$.

\begin{theorem}{(Tits \cite{tits})}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The kernel of the natural map $\widetilde{W_o} \rightarrow \hat{W}_o$
  is $\hat{T}_2$,
\item The elements $\sigma_{\alpha}$ satisfy the braid relations,
\item There is a canonical lifting of $\hat{W}_o$ to a subset of
  $\widetilde{W}$: take a reduced expression $w = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$,
  and let $\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} ... \sigma_{\alpha_n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Let $\phi$ be a TRSELP.  Recall that $\phi(I_F) \subset \hat{T}$ and
$\phi(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} f$, where $f \in \hat{N}$.  Let $\hat{w}$
be the image of $f$ in $\hat{W}_o$, and let $w$ be the element of
$W_o$ corresponding to $\hat{w}$.  Write $\hat{w} = s_{\alpha_1} \cdots s_{\alpha_n}$
as a product of simple reflections, and let
$\tilde{w} = \sigma_{\alpha_1} \cdots \sigma_{\alpha_n}$ be the
canonical lift of $\hat{w}$ to $\widetilde{W}$.

\begin{definition}
Given $\phi$, we define a homomorphism $\phi_o : W_F \rightarrow {}^L G$ by
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi_o|_{I_F} \equiv 1$
\item $\phi_o(\Phi) = \hat{\theta} \tilde{w}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

By the theory in section \ref{preliminaries}, $\phi$ and $\phi_o$ give
rise to a character $\chi_{\phi}$ and $\chi_{\phi_o}$ of
$T(F) = T^{\Phi_{\sigma}}$, respectively.  By the theory in section
\ref{groupsoftypeL}, $\phi$ and $\phi_o$ gives rise to characters
$\chi$ and $\chi_o$ of $T(E)_{\Gamma}$, respectively.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is semisimple, then $\chi \otimes \chi_o^{-1} = \chi_{\phi}$.
\end{proposition}

\proof
Since $G$ is semisimple, $T(F)$ is compact.  In particular,
$\HT{0}(\Gamma, T(E)) = 0$, so we have the following exact
sequence:
$$1 \rightarrow \HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \rightarrow T(E)_{\Gamma} \rightarrow T(F) \rightarrow 1$$
Note that $T(F) = T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$, and so in particular
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$ surjects onto $T(F)$ via the norm map
$N$.  This, together with the fact that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \neq 0$,
gives us that $\HT{-1}(\Gamma,T(E))$ and
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$ together generate $T(E)_{\Gamma}$.

Since $\phi_o|_{I_F} \equiv 1$, $\chi_o$ is trivial on
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$.  By lemma
\ref{grossanddebackerreedercompatibility}, we have that
$(\chi \otimes \chi_o^{-1})|_{T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}} = \chi_{\phi}|_{T(\mathfrak{o}_F)}$.
Therefore, $\chi \otimes \chi_o^{-1}$ is correct on
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$.  Moreover, by Lemma
\ref{toralmodification}, we also have that $\chi$ and $\chi_o$ have
the same restriction to $\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E))$.  Therefore,
$\chi \otimes \chi_o^{-1}$ is a character of $T(F)$.  Since
$\chi \otimes \chi_o^{-1}$ is correct on $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$, and
since $T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma} \xrightarrow{N} T(F)$ is surjective,
we are done.  (Do we need at some point that
$\HT{-1}(\Gamma, T(E)) \bigcap T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma} = 1$?
It's true, because otherwise, there would be a nontrivial element in
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$ that mapped to the trivial element in
$T(F)$ via the norm map.  But this can't be, because
$T(\mathfrak{o}_E)_{\Gamma}$ is isomorphic to $T(\mathfrak{o}_F)$ via
the norm map.)
\qed

In the case that $G$ is semisimple, there was nothing special about
$\phi_o$.  In fact, by the same arguments, the rectifier is obtained
from any Langlands parameter $\phi'$ such that $\phi'|_{I_F} \equiv 1$
and $\phi'(\Phi) = w'$, where $w'$ was any lift of $\hat{w}$ to $N$.
However, we will see that the Tits group lift is forced on us when we
consider groups that are not necessarily semisimple, such as $GL(n,F)$.

\section{Rectifiers for $GL(n,F)$}\label{GL(n)}

We first recall the structure of the rectifiers for $GL(n,F)$ in our
setting (see \cite{bushnellhenniart}).

\begin{lemma}
  Suppose that $(E/F, \xi)$ is an admissible pair such that $E/F$ is
  unramified of degree $n$ and $\xi|_{\mathfrak{o}_E} \equiv 1$.  Let
  ${}_F \nu_{\xi}$ be the associated rectifier, as defined in
  \cite{bushnellhenniart}.  Then ${}_F \nu_{\xi}$ is unramified and
  ${}_F \nu_{\xi}(\varpi) = (-1)^{n-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
See \cite[Proposition 21]{bushnellhenniart}.
\qed

\MAxxx{In this section somewhere, should we calculate $\HT{0}$ and
  $\HT{-1}$ for unramified tori of $GL(n)$? We have done this
  already, and it's easy.  Maybe we can use it for something, or
  explain something with it (like Gross's construction, together with
  our rectifiers, for $GL(n)$.  That would be nice)}
